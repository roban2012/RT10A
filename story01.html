The McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), the business and economics research arm of McKinsey & Company, was established in 1990 to develop a deeper understanding of the evolving global economy. Our goal is to provide leaders in the commercial, public, and social sectors with the facts and insights on which to base management and policy decisions.<br><br>
MGI research combines the disciplines of economics and management, employing the analytical tools of economics with the insights of business leaders. Our “micro-to-macro” methodology examines microeconomic industry trends to better understand the broad macroeconomic forces affecting business strategy and public policy. MGI’s in-depth reports have covered more than 20 countries and 30 industries. Current research focuses on four themes: productivity and growth, the evolution of global financial markets, the economic impact of technology and innovation, and urbanization. Recent reports have assessed job creation, resource productivity, cities of the future, and the impact of the Internet.<br><br>
MGI is led by McKinsey & Company directors Richard Dobbs and James Manyika. Yougang Chen, Michael Chui, Susan Lund, and Jaana Remes serve as MGI principals. Project teams are led by a group of senior fellows and include consultants from McKinsey’s offices around the world. These teams draw on McKinsey’s global network of partners and industry and management experts. In addition, leading economists, including Nobel laureates, act as research advisers.<br><br>
The partners of McKinsey & Company fund MGI’s research; it is not commissioned by any business, government, or other institution.<br><br>

Disruptive technologies: Advances that will transform life, business, and the global economy<br><br>

Technology is moving so quickly, and in so many directions, that it becomes
challenging to even pay attention―we are victims of “next new thing” fatigue.<br><br>
Yet technology advancement continues to drive economic growth and, in some
cases, unleash disruptive change. Economically disruptive technologies―like
the semiconductor microchip, the Internet, or steam power in the Industrial
Revolution―transform the way we live and work, enable new business models,
and provide an opening for new players to upset the established order. Business
leaders and policy makers need to identify potentially disruptive technologies, and
carefully consider their potential, before these technologies begin to exert their
disruptive powers in the economy and society.<br><br>
In this report, the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) assesses the potential reach
and scope, as well as the potential economic impact and disruption, of major
rapidly advancing technology areas. Through extensive research, we sort through
the noise to identify 12 technology areas with the potential for massive impact on
how people live and work, and on industries and economies. We also attempt
to quantify the potential economic impact of each technology across a set of
promising applications in 2025.<br><br>
By definition such an exercise is incomplete―technology and innovations always
surprise. The potential applications we consider reflect what McKinsey experts
and respected leaders in industry and academia who aided our research believe
are illustrative of emerging applications over the next decade or two and provide a
good indication of the size and shape of the impact that these applications could
have. The combined potential economic impact by 2025 from the applications of
the 12 technologies that we have sized may be denominated in the tens of trillions
of dollars per year. Some of this economic potential will end up as consumer
surplus; a substantial portion of this economic potential will tranlate into new
revenue that companies will capture and that will contribute to GDP growth. Other
effects could include shifts in profit pools between companies and industries.<br><br>
Our goal in pursuing this research is not to make predictions, either about the
specific applications or the specific sizes of impact. Rather we hope this report
will act as a guide for leaders to use as they consider the reach and scope of
impact, as well as the types of impacts that these disruptive technologies could
have for the growth and performance of their organizations. We fully expect
and hope others will build on and enrich this research, as we plan to do. As a
companion piece to this research on disruptive technologies, we have updated
prior work on business trends enabled by information technologies, which will be
available for download at the MGI website (www.mckinsey.com/mgi).<br><br>

In any case, we believe that these technologies will have large and disruptive
impact. More importantly, the results of our research show that business leaders
and policy makers―and society at large―will confront change on many fronts:<br><br>
in the way businesses organize themselves, how jobs are defined, how we use
technology to interact with the world (and with each other), and, in the case of next-generation genomics, how we understand and manipulate living things. There will be disruptions to established norms, and there will be broad societal challenges. Nevertheless, we see considerable reason for optimism. Many technologies on the horizon offer immense opportunities. We believe that leaders can seize these opportunities, if they start preparing now.<br><br>
This work was led by James Manyika, an MGI director in San Francisco, and Michael Chui, an MGI principal, working closely with McKinsey directors Jacques Bughin and Peter Bisson. We are particularly indebted to our team leaders―Alex Marrs, who managed the project, and Joi Danielson, who co-led a portion of the research. The project team included Hyungpyo Choi, Shalabh Gupta, Tim Wegner, Angela Winkle, and Sabina Wizander. Geoffrey Lewis provided editorial support, Karla Arias assisted with research, and we thank the MGI production and communication staff: Marisa Carder, Julie Philpot, Gabriela Ramirez, and Rebeca Robboy.<br><br>

Katy George, a director in the North American Operations Practice, provided expertise on manufacturing, as did Lou Rassey, a principal in the practice. Susan Lund, an MGI principal, provided insight on the changing nature of work and on energy. We were assisted by many experts in our Business Technology Office, including Steve Cheng and Brian Milch, as well as Bryan Hancock from the Public Sector Practice and Jimmy Sarakatsannis from the Social Sector Practice. We also thank Jonathan Ablett, Sree Ramaswamy, and Vivien Singer for their help on many topics.<br><br>
We are grateful to our external advisers Hal R. Varian, chief economist at Google and emeritus professor in the School of Information, the Haas School of Business and the Department of Economics at the University of California at Berkeley; Erik Brynjolfsson, Schussel Family professor of management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, director of the MIT Center for Digital Business, and research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research; and Martin Baily, senior fellow in the Economic Studies Program and Bernard L. Schwartz Chair in Economic Policy Development at the Brookings Institution.<br><br>
This work benefited from the insight of many technology and business thought leaders, including Chamath Palihapitiya, founder and managing partner of The Social+Capital Partnership and a former Facebook executive; Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google; and Padmasree Warrior, chief technology and strategy officer of Cisco. We also thank McKinsey alumni Jennifer Buechel, Rob Jenks, and David Mann, as well as Vivek Wadhwa, vice president of innovation and research at Singularity University; and Ann Winblad, managing director of Hummer Winblad Venture Partners. We thank David Kirkpatrick, CEO of Techonomy; and Paddy Cosgrave, founder of F.ounders.<br><br>

Mobile Internet<br><br>
In just a few years, Internet-enabled portable devices have gone from a luxury for a few to a way of life for more than one billion people who own smartphones and tablets. In the United States, an estimated 30 percent of Web browsing and 40 percent of social media use are done on mobile devices; by 2015, wireless Web use is expected to exceed wired use. Ubiquitous connectivity and an explosive proliferation of apps are enabling users to go about their daily routines with new ways of knowing, perceiving, and even interacting with the physical world. The technology of the mobile Internet is evolving rapidly, with intuitive interfaces and new formats, including wearable devices. The mobile Internet also has applications across businesses and the public sector, enabling more efficient delivery of many services and creating opportunities to increase workforce productivity. In developing economies, the mobile Internet could bring billions of people into the connected world.<br><br>
Automation of knowledge work<br><br>
Advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural user interfaces (e.g., voice recognition) are making it possible to automate many knowledge worker tasks that have long been regarded as impossible or impractical for machines to perform. For instance, some computers can answer “unstructured” questions (i.e., those posed in ordinary language, rather than precisely written as software queries), so employees or customers without specialized training can get information on their own. This opens up possibilities for sweeping change in how knowledge work is organized and performed. Sophisticated analytics tools can be used to augment the talents of highly skilled employees, and as more knowledge worker tasks can be done by machine, it is also possible that some types of jobs could become fully automated.<br><br>
The Internet of Things<br><br>
The Internet of Things―embedding sensors and actuators in machines and other physical objects to bring them into the connected world―is spreading rapidly. From monitoring the flow of products through a factory to measuring the moisture in a field of crops to tracking the flow of water through utility pipes, the Internet of Things allows businesses and public-sector organizations to manage assets, optimize performance, and create new business models. With remote monitoring, the Internet of Things also has great potential to improve the health of patients with chronic illnesses and attack a major cause of rising health-care costs.<br><br>
Cloud technology<br><br>
With cloud technology, any computer application or service can be delivered over a network or the Internet, with minimal or no local software or processing power required. In order to do this, IT resources (such as computation and storage) are made available on an as-needed basis―when extra capacity is needed it is seamlessly added, without requiring up-front investment in new hardware or programming. The cloud is enabling the explosive growth of Internet-based services, from search to streaming media to offline storage of personal data (photos, books, music), as well as the background processing capabilities that enable mobile Internet devices to do things like respond to spoken commands to ask for directions. The cloud can also improve the economics of IT for companies and governments, as well as provide greater flexibility and responsiveness. Finally, the cloud can enable entirely new business models, including all kinds of pay-as-you-go service models.<br><br>

Advanced robotics<br><br>
For the past several decades, industrial robots have taken on physically difficult,
dangerous, or dirty jobs, such as welding and spray painting. These robots have
been expensive, bulky, and inflexible―bolted to the floor and fenced off to protect
workers. Now, more advanced robots are gaining enhanced senses, dexterity,
and intelligence, thanks to accelerating advancements in machine vision, artificial
intelligence, machine-to-machine communication, sensors, and actuators. These
robots can be easier for workers to program and interact with. They can be more
compact and adaptable, making it possible to deploy them safely alongside
workers. These advances could make it practical to substitute robots for human
labor in more manufacturing tasks, as well as in a growing number of service
jobs, such as cleaning and maintenance. This technology could also enable new
types of surgical robots, robotic prosthetics, and “exoskeleton” braces that can
help people with limited mobility to function more normally, helping to improve
and extend lives.<br><br>
Next-generation genomics<br><br>
Next-generation genomics marries advances in the science of sequencing and
modifying genetic material with the latest big data analytics capabilities. Today,
a human genome can be sequenced in a few hours and for a few thousand
dollars, a task that took 13 years and $2.7 billion to accomplish during the
Human Genome Project. With rapid sequencing and advanced computing
power, scientists can systematically test how genetic variations can bring about
specific traits and diseases, rather than using trial and error. Relatively low-cost
desktop sequencing machines could be used in routine diagnostics, potentially
significantly improving treatments by matching treatments to patients. The next
step is synthetic biology―the ability to precisely customize organisms by “writing”
DNA. These advances in the power and availability of genetic science could have
profound impact on medicine, agriculture, and even the production of high-value
substances such as biofuels―as well as speed up the process of drug discovery.<br><br>
Autonomous and near-autonomous vehicles<br><br>
It is now possible to create cars, trucks, aircraft, and boats that are completely
or partly autonomous. From drone aircraft on the battlefield to Google’s selfdriving
car, the technologies of machine vision, artificial intelligence, sensors,
and actuators that make these machines possible is rapidly improving. Over
the coming decade, low-cost, commercially available drones and submersibles
could be used for a range of applications. Autonomous cars and trucks could
enable a revolution in ground transportation―regulations and public acceptance
permitting. Short of that, there is also substantial value in systems that assist
drivers in steering, braking, and collision avoidance. The potential benefits of
autonomous cars and trucks include increased safety, reduced CO2 emissions,
more leisure or work time for motorists (with hands-off driving), and increased
productivity in the trucking industry.<br><br>

Energy storage<br><br>
Energy storage technology includes batteries and other systems that store energy for later use. Lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells are already powering electric and hybrid vehicles, along with billions of portable consumer electronics devices. Li-ion batteries in particular have seen consistent increases in performance and reductions in price, with cost per unit of storage capacity declining dramatically over the past decade. Over the next decade, advances in energy storage technology could make electric vehicles (hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and all-electrics) cost competitive with vehicles based on internal-combustion engines. On the power grid, advanced battery storage systems can help with the integration of solar and wind power, improve quality by controlling frequency variations, handle peak loads, and reduce costs by enabling utilities to postpone infrastructure expansion. In developing economies, battery/solar systems have the potential to bring reliable power to places it has never reached.<br><br>
3D printing<br><br>
Until now, 3D printing has largely been used by product designers and hobbyists and for a few select manufacturing applications. However, the performance of additive manufacturing machinery is improving, the range of materials is expanding, and prices (for both printers and materials) are declining rapidly―bringing 3D printing to a point where it could see rapid adoption by consumers and even for more manufacturing uses. With 3D printing, an idea can go directly from a 3D design file to a finished part or product, potentially skipping many traditional manufacturing steps. Importantly, 3D printing enables on-demand production, which has interesting implications for supply chains and for stocking spare parts―a major cost for manufacturers. 3D printing can also reduce the amount of material wasted in manufacturing and create objects that are difficult or impossible to produce with traditional techniques. Scientists have even “bioprinted” organs, using an inkjet printing technique to layer human stem cells along with supporting scaffolding.<br><br>
Advanced materials<br><br>
Over the past few decades, scientists have discovered ways to produce materials with incredible attributes―smart materials that are self-healing or self-cleaning; memory metals that can revert to their original shapes; piezoelectric ceramics and crystals that turn pressure into energy; and nanomaterials. Nanomaterials in particular stand out in terms of their high rate of improvement, broad potential applicability, and long-term potential to drive massive economic impact. At nanoscale (less than 100 nanometers), ordinary substances take on new properties―greater reactivity, unusual electrical properties, enormous strength per unit of weight―that can enable new types of medicine, super-slick coatings, stronger composites, and other improvements. Advanced nanomaterials such as graphene and carbon nanotubes could drive particularly significant impact. For example, graphene and carbon nanotubes could help create new types of displays and super-efficient batteries and solar cells. Finally, pharmaceutical companies are already progressing in research to use nanoparticles for targeted drug treatments for diseases such as cancer.<br><br>

Advanced oil and gas exploration and recovery<br><br>
The ability to extract so-called unconventional oil and gas reserves from shale
rock formations is a technology revolution that has been gathering force for nearly
four decades. The combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing
makes it possible to reach oil and gas deposits that were known to exist in
the United States and other places but that were not economically accessible
by conventional drilling methods. The potential impact of this technology has
received enormous attention. With continued improvements, this technology
could significantly increase the availability of fossil fuels for decades and produce
an immediate boon for energy-intensive industries such as petrochemicals
manufacturing. Eventually, improving technology for oil and gas exploration and
recovery could even unlock new types of reserves, including coalbed methane,
tight sandstones, and methane clathrates (also known as methane hydrates),
potentially ushering in another energy “revolution.”<br><br>
Renewable energy<br><br>
Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro-electric, and ocean wave
hold the promise of an endless source of power without stripping resources,
contributing to climate change, or worrying about competition for fossil fuels.<br><br>
Solar cell technology is progressing particularly rapidly. In the past two decades,
the cost of power produced by solar cells has dropped from nearly $8 per watt
of capacity to one-tenth of that amount. Meanwhile, wind power constitutes
a rapidly growing proportion of renewable electricity generation. Renewable
energy sources such as solar and wind are increasingly being adopted at scale in
advanced economies like the United States and the European Union. Even more
importantly, China, India, and other emerging economies have aggressive plans
for solar and wind adoption that could enable further rapid economic growth
while mitigating growing concerns about pollution.<br><br>
The 12 technologies in our final list do not represent all potentially economically
disruptive technologies in 2025. Many of the other advancing technologies that
we reviewed are also worth following and thinking about. In our view they do
not have the same potential for economic impact and disruption by 2025, but
we cannot rule out sudden breakthroughs or other factors, such as new public
policies, that might change that (see Box 1, “Other technologies on the radar”).<br><br>

The United States faces a future in which the elements of economic leadership are moving abroad. Reversing these trends will require the private and public sectors to collaborate.<br><br>
May 2011   byJames Manyika, Daniel Pacthod, and Michael Park<br><br>





Is America losing its innovation edge? For decades, the country has debated this question in the halls of Washington, on the nightly news, and in corporate boardrooms. Pundits have looked abroad for signs―from the Soviets during the Cold War to the Japanese in the late 1980s to the Asian Tigers1  in the early 2000s―that the United States was losing its economic advantage. Pessimists point to startling statistics, such as the rise in the number of patents filed by foreign inventors or the growing corps of engineers graduating overseas.<br><br>

These statistics are indeed alarming. Yet despite the historical challenges, the United States has remained the home of innovation. From the Internet to mainframe servers to pharmaceuticals, major innovations are still “Made in the USA.”<br><br>

So what is the disconnect? Is America’s innovation advantage simply too large to overcome? Are numbers of patents and engineers no longer relevant metrics in a digital world? Perhaps. However, we think that looking solely at innovation and leadership in basic research is far too narrow. The key question is whether the United States has been losing its ability to translate innovation into economic leadership. <br><br>

To answer this question, building on recent McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) research on productivity and on the role of US multinationals, we conducted a series of interviews with CEOs of advanced industrial companies. These CEOs, who lead R&D- and engineering-intensive companies ranging from automobile and energy-equipment manufacturers to aerospace and defense players, stand on the front lines of this debate. From our conversations and original research, we see real cause for alarm.<br><br>

Innovation may create profits and headlines, but it is only part of the economic engine. Intel’s Andy Grove writes that the United States has “misplaced faith in the power of start-ups.” German research labs may have created the MP3, but it was the scale-up capabilities of American technology firms that took this innovation and unlocked its value, from Apple’s iPod to file sharing to digital-media vendors like the iTunes store, and beyond. This ability to take basic innovation, deliver it at scale, and refine it with second- and third-order innovations plays a critical role in driving growth and jobs. To do all this, a country must be at the center of cutting-edge technologies, market demand, talent, and entrepreneurial spirit. <br><br>

We see warning signs regarding each of these elements. The problems go well beyond jobs or patents―to the heart of US economic leadership. We do not have all the answers, but we are convinced that a course correction is necessary. Incremental steps by the public sector, through one-off tax credits and piecemeal government programs, won’t be sufficient. Neither will the short-term, quarter-to-quarter mentality in America’s corporate boardrooms. A national commitment and strategy are required.<br><br>

What are the facts?<br><br>

Is the United States truly behind? From one angle, it’s hard to see anything but positives. The country has a business culture and a legal and capital market system that encourage and reward risk taking and entrepreneurship. It continues to attract top students and teachers from around the globe and remains the dominant investor in research and development, with total spending more than that of the next four nations―Japan, China, Germany, and South Korea―combined.<br><br>

There are clear warning signs, however, across the facets of economic leadership.<br><br>

Cutting-edge technology<br><br>

In leading industrial technologies―such as advanced batteries, high-speed rail, hybrid automobiles, solar modules, offshore wind turbines, and machine tools―the United States finds itself competing against or even catching up with foreign companies and engineers. Historically, the country has been the undisputed leader of next-generation technology, from semiconductors to IT to space. It pretty much owned these sectors. But today, even in an industry such as space, the United States finds itself relying on Japan, Russia, and Western Europe to launch its satellites. This issue goes beyond the well-publicized discussion around US jobs. It is at the heart of economic leadership. Without preeminence in cutting-edge technology (and the business, communications, and physical infrastructure to support it), the jobs question is moot.<br><br>

Demand<br><br>

The composition of global demand has changed dramatically over the past few decades. For the first time in recent history, more than 50 percent of the global middle class lives outside North America. Meanwhile, many next-generation engineered products are in high demand not by US or European customers but by those in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. From airplanes to offshore wind turbines to nuclear technology, these foreign customers are creating markets and dictating preferences, often with local-content requirements. US companies can no longer build products just for the US market and expect to export them readily without modification.<br><br>

Talent<br><br>

Partly as a result of the declining prestige of the US engineering profession and the lagging effectiveness of the education system, scientific talent is building outside the United States. Almost one-third of US manufacturing companies responding to a recent survey2  say they are suffering from some level of skill shortage. Foreign labs are becoming more ambitious, leading cutting-edge research that used to be the exclusive domain of US companies and universities.<br><br>

Entrepreneurial spirit<br><br>

Entrepreneurship is the magic that binds all these elements, yet we see an increasing risk aversion toward new ventures in the United States. Large US corporations, the innovators of the previous generation, seem most affected. Part but not all of this behavior results from uncertainty about public policy and regulation, but some of it reflects past successes and a failure to think in the long term. Many of America’s leading advanced industrial companies report returns on capital well above 20 to 30 percent or more―the result of decades of productivity and ingenuity but also of a depreciated existing asset base. Too often, decisions to finance and push into new product areas or to enter new geographical markets die because companies fear to dilute these high returns. Worse yet, to meet short-term earnings objectives, companies defer promising but risky plans.<br><br>

How should the United States respond?<br><br>

Public policy, private-sector shortsightedness, offshored manufacturing, unfair foreign subsidies, or any combination of these can all be blamed for the warning signs above. Whatever the cause, the United States faces a future in which the key elements of economic leadership are moving abroad. Action is imperative. Revitalizing US innovation and growth will require a national commitment in which the public and private sectors work together. Our research suggests a number of steps to start changing the trends.<br><br>

1. Clear the way for the cutting-edge industrial technologies of the future<br><br>

To meet this goal, policy makers must ramp up public-sector procurement targets and set standards for next-generation technologies. Examples of the necessary policies include (1) clean power, through national standards for renewable energy; (2) transport, through mandated improvements in the fuel efficiency of automobiles; and (3) advanced composites, through Department of Defense procurement and airplane-efficiency standards. <br><br>

The private sector will have to ease its paranoia about intellectual property and collaboration. US leadership in semiconductors was in part enabled by projects such as Sematech, an industry consortium to share R&D. Other advanced industries have not followed suit; the number of such partnerships outside the IT sector has stagnated.<br><br>

2. Rebuild infrastructure<br><br>

Part of this national strategy calls for infrastructure upgrades to support US production and engineering and to cut through well-meaning but burdensome red tape and regulations that add costs and time to construction. The necessary actions include the following:<br><br>


 
Fast track the approval process and standards setting for selected high-priority technology areas (for example, accelerated LED-bulb-technology review, clarification of unconventional gas and wastewater standards).<br><br>

 
Create manufacturing-development zones with fast-track site approval.
<br><br>
 
Develop investment incentives―for example, by allowing the tax-free repatriation of capital to finance US investment, thus tying R&D tax credits to US production.<br><br>

 
Emphasize efforts to build “smart infrastructure,” such as fiber-optic cable.<br><br>


To help public policy coalesce and support these initiatives for infrastructure and production upgrades, private-sector leaders must work together to communicate a comprehensive social value proposition―for example, energy efficiency, reduced pollution, and an improved traffic flow―not just jobs.
<br><br>
3. Attract and retain talent<br><br>

After foreign students study at US universities, the country pushes them away with restrictive H1-B3  policies. Later they work for (or start up) future competitors while US companies struggle with an aging engineering workforce. The necessary moves include the following:<br><br>
 
Streamline green card application processes and increase the number of H1-B visas―now capped at 65,000 but in 2003 as high as 195,000.<br><br>

 
Expand efforts such as the US Department of Labor’s High Growth Job Training Initiative, which targets 14 key sectors for investments in workforce development.<br><br>



 
Renew private-sector efforts to train, develop, and retain current engineers.<br><br>


4. Reenergize the entrepreneurial spirit in large US companies<br><br>

The rapid expansion of small, inventive companies that grow up to become large ones innovating at scale is one of the hallmarks of US leadership. The country should continue to encourage this model, and more executives of large companies should embrace it. Many of our largest, most successful industrial clients are far too wary of long-term investments, which they often measure with short-term financial-performance metrics. Executives must reshape Wall Street’s quarter-to-quarter mentality and help these companies make the same kinds of bold but prudent decisions that made them great in the past.
<br><br>

We are confident that the United States can realize its innovation and growth potential. Its natural advantages are undeniable. But other countries are building up cutting-edge technology, demand, talent, and entrepreneurism, while the United States seems to be in retreat. The public and private sectors must work together to reverse that trend.<br><br>

Back in 2011, when we began work on a McKinsey Quarterly article called “A CEO’s guide to innovation in China,”1  much of the debate was about whether the country was more likely to become innovative or to remain a fast follower of foreign leaders. Even then, that seemed like yesterday's question. Companies in China were innovating; we were seeing that every day in areas such as renewable energy, consumer electronics, instant messaging, and mobile gaming, both at domestic players and at multinationals with significant research and product-development presences.<br><br>
<a href= "pic04.html">2025年Fortune Global 500 companies（财富500）</a><br><br>
<a href= "pic05.html">大公司聚集的大城市</a><br><br>

Nothing that has happened since has changed our view. Indeed, our sense today is that the pace of innovation is quickening and that a new spirit of innovation is spreading across sectors into universities and even into key departments of the Chinese government. In a recent series of interviews with executives at Chinese companies, we detected evidence of real innovation leadership and the potential for more to come. John Oyler, CEO of the three-year-old Chinese biotech company BeiGene, for instance, underscored the attitude―“anything is possible, we can make it happen, there is no challenge we cannot conquer, we will surprise the world”―that he’s now seeing among Chinese scientists at his company.<br><br>

In fact, a wide range of companies have begun mounting challenges in sectors traditionally the preserve of US, European, Japanese, or South Korean businesses. Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), for example, the world’s biggest genetic-sequencing company, now claims to account for roughly 50 percent of global capacity and probably sequences more genetic material than Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology combined, while developing some of the world’s most advanced biologic-computing models. In information and communications technology, Huawei attracted attention at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas, with innovative new smartphone platforms built on chips and software designed in-house. Another smartphone player, Xiaomi, founded in 2010 and often compared to Apple for its marketing strategy and loyal following, is on track to sell more than 15 million phones this year. Midea surprised its industry recently by announcing a highly efficient 1-hertz variable-speed air-conditioning compressor ahead of foreign competitors. And YY.com, a voice-based communications and gaming service, has captured growing attention with its mass online karaoke.<br><br>
In our previous article, we suggested that tomorrow’s winners in China would focus on infusing their innovation efforts with a more sophisticated understanding of Chinese customers, retaining local talent, instilling a culture of risk taking, and promoting internal collaboration. This list remains crucial, but it is incomplete. In this article, based on recent interviews and our work with dozens of Chinese companies, we want to highlight three more recent developments that are likely to shape the innovation environment during the years ahead: the growing role of Chinese universities in the local innovation ecosystem; the gathering local interest in, and concern about, intellectual-property (IP) protection; and the emergence of a new generation of talent. If we are right that these forces are accelerating China’s realization of its innovation potential, then embracing them is mission critical―for Chinese companies and multinationals alike.<br><br>

1. Seek Chinese universities as innovation partners<br><br>

The prevailing view of Chinese universities is that they are highly effective at turning out large numbers of reasonably well-qualified specialists whose strengths are in the application of existing practices to predefined problems and whose future may lie in shanzhai (“copycat”) innovation. But that picture is changing rapidly, with the best universities starting to recruit the world’s top faculty talent  for priority disciplines and creating an environment where breakthroughs can happen. When Fudan University wanted to develop a wastewater-treatment science program, for example, it hired one of the world’s top thinkers on the topic, who was teaching and conducting research in Singapore at the time. Globally recognized scientific journals are also increasingly filled with publications from leading Chinese researchers: Nature, for example, published 303 papers by Chinese scientists in 2012, up from 46 in 2006.<br><br>

As Chinese universities raise their game, they are becoming increasingly interesting innovation partners for a wide range of domestic and global companies. To some extent, this is nothing new: Intel, for example, has long collaborated with these universities to sponsor research projects, PhD theses, and technical forums related to technology that’s close to the company’s business. What seems to be changing is the growing use of Chinese universities as a form of “outsourced R&D,” to borrow a phrase from an executive we interviewed recently.<br><br>

One Chinese packaged-goods company conducts food-science research almost entirely through the labs of a local university. Pei-Yuan Peng, vice president and head of LG Electronics’s Shanghai-based R&D center, recently described for us the range of joint-research efforts his company undertakes with leading Chinese university labs and the role that Chinese professors play in helping LG recruit the best and brightest Chinese researchers and engineers. Meanwhile, in the life-sciences sector, BeiGene’s Oyler describes Chinese universities and research institutions as underappreciated treasure troves of innovation pockets. Oyler’s team actively collaborates with scientists at the National Institute of Biological Science located across the street from BeiGene’s headquarters and full of creative, passionate world-class scientists. Last year, the institute (headed by Xiaodong Wang, a member of the US Academy of Sciences) discovered the hepatitis B virus receptorCa huge advance against one of the most common chronic diseases in Asia. Researchers from the two organizations trade ideas in both formal and informal meetings.2 <br><br>

There are risks for multinationals, to be sure. Many Chinese universities have strong ties to the government, whose prioritization of domestic innovation may discourage close and open work on advanced topics. As LG’s Peng points out, though, those ties also mean that Chinese professors often pick up valuable information from government officials about changes in policy direction and market rules. Multinationals that make Chinese universities part of their innovation ecosystem are likely to gain earlier access to these insights, too.<br><br>

2. Make intellectual-property protection a core part of innovation culture<br><br>

The government has become noticeably more active in its support of intellectual-property protection. Gao Feng, deputy director of the Ministry of Public Security’s economic-crime investigation department, has been describing, with surprising openness, the weaknesses of the current IP system and vowing continued improvements. 3  The Chinese government ministry charged with prosecuting intellectual-property violations recently announced that it handled 2,347 cases in 2012, up almost 40 percent from 2011, and over those two years resolved $2 billion in violations.4  And in Jiangsu Province, the local government in Suzhou is building a 500,000-square-meter facility next to its innovation park. The idea is to bring together IP-related agencies and leading technology companies to elevate IP issues in importance, while improving the processing and quality of patent approval and protection. Efforts such as these, while localized, reflect a growing appreciation for the importance of IP protection.<br><br>

Nonetheless, intellectual-property theft―including the reverse-engineering, copying, and sale of components and finished products―remains a concern, particularly for multinationals. Many continue to report deliberate cybersecurity breaches by Chinese hackers trying to steal valuable secrets over corporate computer networks and across national borders. Interestingly, savvy Chinese companies are already working hard to protect themselves. One priority: creating physical barriers to piracy. We’ve seen companies forbidding the use on their campus grounds of PCs, mobile devices, and other electronics not issued by the company. Precautions might extend to not allowing laptops or smartphones to enter or leave the campus, for fear that they might carry sensitive material, and restricting the most sensitive engineering activities to buildings where wireless access is blocked, computers are tied down to desks, and there is no access to external networks.<br><br>

Other practices include compartmentalizing knowledge so that only a few individuals have a complete understanding of complex core systems. It is increasingly common to require camera-enabled devices to be stored under lock and key before entering R&D facilities. Many companies have also banned the use of devices, such as portable hard drives and USB thumb drives, that could be used to transfer media electronically. Haier, for its part, has begun monitoring employee activity on technology platforms, including e-mail and Web browsing.<br><br>

Haier’s experience suggests it is possible to create strong structural safeguards without compromising a company’s innovation culture. Culture, in fact, can be a crucial element of internal IP-protection efforts. Increasingly over the last year or so, we’ve seen companies trying to make intellectual property part of internal codes of conduct and ethics efforts, sometimes demanding an annual review and a formal sign-off process by employees. For multinationals, the opportunity is particularly large: employees who feel they are deeply valued as part of a broader global entity, as opposed to a fungible resource needed to help “crack China,” are less likely to sell company secrets.<br><br>

In an understandable effort to minimize IP leakage, many multinationals inadvertently isolate the Chinese team from the rest of the company. But as one Chinese executive said to us, “If you want Chinese employees to be loyal, then ask yourself how loyal you are to your employees. There must be a mutual feeling of respect to gain their trust.”<br><br>

3. Tap into a younger generation of Chinese talent<br><br>

It's commonly said of China that innovation capacity (measured in terms of patent volumes and the construction of R&D facilities, for example) outstrips capability―in particular, the quality of China’s talent pool. Young Chinese graduates, especially, come under the microscope: educated in large numbers, raised in relative affluence, and more attracted to safe career tracks in the government or state-owned enterprises than to entrepreneurial ones, according to surveys.5 <br><br>

We don’t dispute any of these surveys, but they don’t quite square with our experience meeting young Chinese entrepreneurs such as 28-year-old Guosheng Qi, a Tsinghua University graduate and the founder and CEO of Gridsum, a cloud-based Web-analytics company. Gridsum’s customers range from Baidu to multinationals such as Coca-Cola, and last year it beat out companies from around the world to be named as one of Microsoft’s most innovative new software partners.<br><br>

Leaving aside the entrepreneurial world, we’d also highlight a powerful corporate cross-current that senior leaders, especially at multinationals, should heed. As one Western executive at a Chinese company told us, the simultaneous growth in the number of young graduates and new companies is having an important impact on corporate cultures and individual mind-sets. His logic is that regardless of the attitudes young people bring to the first day on the job, those just entering the professional workforce following their undergraduate or graduate studies are highly malleable to new ways of working. Echoing this viewpoint, Tao-Sang Tong, president of Tencent’s Social Network Group, says his company prefers pulling talent directly from college, “before they are exposed to less innovative Chinese company cultures.”<br><br>

Further, more Chinese graduates now move into the private sector than into any other source of employment. And many of today’s fast-growing companies are more likely to breed innovative habits than were the large-scale “first employers” of the 1980s or 1990s, a substantial number of which were state-owned enterprises or had only recently been privatized. In short, as the number of students entering and graduating from Chinese universities skyrockets (from 1.6 million new students in 1999 to 7.5 million in 2012, and from about 1 million graduating students to 6.7 million for the same years), the Chinese talent landscape is evolving in tandem.6 <br><br>

Yet many multinationals we know seem focused primarily on landing experienced Chinese hires who can help them quickly localize operations. They’re less interested in cultivating the next generation of talent and aren’t looking to it for the fresh ideas needed to sustain and grow their businesses. Indeed, only about 17 percent of respondents to a recent McKinsey survey of high-tech companies (including multinationals) operating in China described their development efforts there as leading edge.<br><br>

Contrast all that with the approach of companies such as Lenovo, which, according to chief technology officer (CTO) George He, hires roughly 70 percent of its fresh talent straight from Chinese universities. Multinationals should certainly embrace the young-talent pool. But more than that, they are unlikely to overcome their established habits until they shift innovation decision-making authority to China. Companies can move in this direction by creating autonomous “ring fenced” Chinese R&D budgets and by permanently relocating the CTO or other innovation-related senior-executive roles to China.<br><br>

Microsoft is an interesting example of a multinational raising its game with young talent in China. Ya-Qin Zhang, corporate vice president and chairman of Microsoft’s Asia-Pacific Research and Development Group, oversees the company’s Asia-Pacific R&D headquarters in Beijing. He proudly showed us around the new Azure accelerator, which is intended to help start-ups make use of the Azure cloud-computing platform when they set up their companies. Business teams submit proposals to a contest and are selected to join the accelerator, where they are assigned an executive sponsor and receive training from Microsoft engineers. The incubator represents more than a cloud-computing play; it’s also part of a long-term effort by Microsoft to boost its visibility among rising engineering talent. This effort appears to be paying off. Ya-Qin Zhang commented during our tour that the engineers Microsoft can recruit in China are now on par with those hired at its corporate headquarters, in Redmond, Washington―a big change from the prevailing reality ten years ago.<br><br>

The Chinese model for innovation, and the kinds of breakthroughs Chinese organizations achieve, are likely to be quite different from those of Western ones. There is a greater willingness in China to go directly from development (usually based on already-known or highly anticipated customer orders) to manufacturing and shipping products. Circumventing the traditional “create, test, refine, develop, produce, market, sell” innovation process of many Western companies breeds speed, in the form of shorter time frames to launch and scale new businesses. That will be difficult for many multinationals to match. We constantly hear from these companies’ innovation and product managers about their struggles, through seemingly endless sets of steps and approvals, to make “China for China” innovation a reality instead of merely corporate rhetoric.<br><br>

The Chinese approach also has its limitations; we’ve all seen evidence of quality breakdowns, excess waste in the development process, and unpredictability in production, all of which open the door for multinationals. Those that are not only inspired by the latest surge of Chinese energy but also mindful of the latest trends in universities, IP, and talent will be among the winners, turning out cutting-edge products of the kind we now still associate with the United States, Europe, Japan, and South Korea.<br><br>

An executive with 20 years of experience in China says that to succeed there, leaders must learn to think differently and devote particular attention to people.<br><br>
July 2013  by Nandani Lynton<br><br>


<a href= "link04.html">中美财经期刊编辑思想比较</a><br><br>


Despite decades of experience in China, many organizations still struggle to identify and select executives who will make a tangible impact there. My research and experience suggest that companies can do better by focusing on two crucial skills―an ability to read the external environment and an understanding of what makes employees tick―and on a tough truth: a generational challenge is making the talent equation more complex.<br><br>

Everything is political. Being effective in China means realizing that everything is political. Executives must have a keen grasp of political and social trends so they can position their business strategies and communications within that landscape. One example is the reframing of proposals for corporate-social-responsibility initiatives, to promote the “harmonious society” when that was proclaimed as a government priority.<br><br>

Executives must develop a nonmarket business strategy, as well as the usual market strategy, for China. The nonmarket strategy includes plans for building a network that intersects with the government, business partners, suppliers, customers, and other industry and public stakeholders.<br><br>

Successful executives develop their intuition, are receptive to learning from Chinese patterns, and thus begin to think and behave differently. The sort of linear analysis generally favored in the West divides a problem into its component parts and seeks rational solutions. Intuitive thinkers seek patterns and relationships between a problem and its context, including contradictions. “The Chinese don’t polarize―it’s the last thing a Chinese would do; we get moving instead,” says the Chinese head of a global life-sciences company.<br><br>

Everything is personal. Managers in China need to pay more personal attention to staff and colleagues than managers in many other cultures do. The head of China operations for a major global manufacturing concern says he does his e-mails and reports during the evening because during the day he needs to talk with employees or meet external stakeholders. In China, leadership is a contact sport.<br><br>

Senior leaders too often succumb to time pressures and put the wrong candidate in charge. One European retailer, for example, chose a manager to head up its China operations who had an excellent track record in his home market but lacked any experience outside Europe and was a poor listener. Within months, relationships with the retailer’s Chinese joint-venture partner were shaky, several well-qualified Europeans had resigned, and staffing was behind schedule. Employees said the executive did not care about their observations and ideas, expected the staff only to follow his instructions, and did not listen to customer feedback. After two years, the executive was replaced, but the damage was done and the operations closed 18 months later.<br><br>

To keep capable staff from becoming disengaged, demotivated, and disinclined to share important information gleaned from interactions with customers and suppliers, the best companies have a culture, set from the top, of working toward common goals in a spirit of mutual respect.<br><br>

It’s getting harder. The talent challenge for multinational companies in China has intensified since the generation born in the 1980s began to take on managerial responsibility. As a result of the government’s one-child policy and the uneven pattern of higher education, many businesses are facing a shortage of capable young executives. Moreover, the new generation of leaders demands both purpose and workClife balance, and no longer automatically accepts hierarchy in the workplace. The best way to retain these leaders is to have role models who inspire commitment―which makes it even more important to select leaders who can read and respond sincerely to their stakeholders.<br><br>

从基因科学到移动应用程序的创新无不取得重要进展，但透过表象看真实情况具有更深远的意义。<br><br>
2012年我们在《麦肯锡季刊》刊登了《CEO中国创新指南》 一文，该文的讨论重点是中国能否成为创新大国，还是维持快速跟进国外领先业者的模式。实际上，这个问题在当时已显得过时，因为中国的企业已投身于创新，每一天，我们都看见拥有庞大产品研发体系的国内外业者在可再生能源、消费电子、即时通讯或是移动游戏等各个领域上演着创新。 <br><br>

现在，我们仍然坚持这一观点。事实上，我们感到创新的步调更快了，且一股新的创新风气在各行业逐渐散布开来，甚至大学和中国政府的关键部门也置身其中。在近期与中国企业高管的一系列访谈中，我们也发现了真正创新领导者的明证，以及未来出现更多创新领导者的可能性。例如成立仅三年的中国生物科技公司百济神州，其首席执行官欧雷强(John Oyler)就特别提到他在公司里看到的中国科学人员的态度―“没有不可能的事，我们要化想法为现实，没有不能克服的挑战，我们要让全世界赞叹称奇”。 其实在许多传统上由欧美日韩称雄的产业中，我们看到不少企业开始发动攻势。例如全球最大的基因序列公司北京基因组研究所就宣称该机构占全球约五成的产能，其测定的遗传物质序列数甚至超过哈佛大学和麻省理工学院两大学府的加总，该公司同时还从事全球若干最先进的生物计算模型的开发。<br><br>
在信息和通信科技方面，华为在今年拉斯维加斯的消费电子展上，推出搭载自主设计的晶片和软件的新款创新智能手机平台，令人为之惊艳。而成立于2010年有“中国苹果”之称的智能手机业者小米，预计今年可以顺利卖出超过1500万台手机。美的近期宣布推出一款领先国际竞争对手的高效率1赫兹变频空调压缩机，也着实让同业大吃一惊。 <br><br>
另外，提供语音通讯和游戏服务的歪歪语音也以其大众在线卡拉OK的服务而声名雀起。 在2013年的文章中，我们也提到未来的赢家必须对中国消费者有更深刻的了解，并将其融入创新活动，同时必须要留住本地人才，并培养勇于承担风险的组织文化 ，以及促进组织内部合作。这些条件的重要性不变，但时至今日，单单具备这些条件并不足以成为市场赢家。本文结合近期的访谈，以及我们与数十家中国企业的合作经验，指出未来几年将影响创新环境的三大发展趋势：中国大学学府在地方的创新生态中扮演的角色日益重要；中国本地对保护知识产权的兴趣和关注提高；新一代人才的出现。<br><br>
如果我们没看错，这些力量将会加速实现创新潜能，因为不论是本土企业或跨国企业，能不能积极把握这些力量将会是成败的关键。 1. 寻求大学成为创新伙伴 对于中国的大学，人们的普遍看法是能够高效培育出大量具有一定资质的专业人才，他们擅长将现行的解决之道应用在既定的问题上，而这些人才的未来出路可能是“山寨创新”（copycat）。<br><br>
但这一现象正在发生快速变化，顶尖学府针对重点学科已经启动全球顶尖教职人员的招聘，以培育创新的环境。例如为了发展废水处理的科研课程，复旦大学从新加坡“挖”来了该领域一位全球享有盛誉的学者和研究者。全球知名的科技期刊也出现越来越多中国研究人员的文章：例如《自然》(Nature)杂志2006年刊登的中国科学家的论文才46篇，到了2012年高达303篇。 <br><br>
随着高等学府不断提高自身素质，它们逐渐成为相关领域国内外企业考虑的创新合作伙伴。说起来这也不是新的现象，例如英特尔长期以来跟这些大学合作，针对与该公司业务相关的技术，提供研究项目、博士论文及技术论坛的赞助。唯一不同的是，越来越多企业把中国大学视为，套句我们近期访谈的一位高管的话，“外包研发”平台。 <br><br>
中国某包装品公司的食品科学研究几乎完全在本地一所大学的实验室里进行。LG上海研发中心副总裁兼负责人彭培源最近为我们说明了该公司与顶尖中国大学实验室的联合研究项目范围，以及中国教授如何协助LG招聘最聪明、最优质的中国研究人员与工程师。同时在生命科学领域，百济神州首席执行官欧雷强也谈到中国的大学是价值被低估的宝藏，蕴藏着丰富的“能成功解决棘手问题的创意人才”。欧雷强的团队积极与中国生命科学研究所（与百济神州总部隔街相望）的科学家积极合作，该研究所去年发现乙肝病毒受体，使得这一亚洲慢性流行病的防御工作向前迈进了一大步。这两个单位的研究人员主要是通过各种正式和非正式的会议不断交流思想。 <br><br>
对跨国企业而言，这样的做法自然也存在风险。中国许多大学都跟政府关系紧密，而政府对国内创新的重视可能会对密集开放式的先进技术研究产生不利影响。尽管如此，乐金的彭副总也指出，正是因为大学与政府的这层关系，大学教授往往能从政府得到政策方向和市场规范改变的宝贵信息。因此，将中国大学纳入企业创新体系的跨国企业，也可能因此有机会及早洞察这些蛛丝马迹。<br><br> 
2.创新文化的核心要素是保护知识产权 中国政府在保护知识产权方面的努力也更为积极。例如中国公安部经济犯罪侦查局副局长高峰，以令人意料的坦诚指出当前知识产权的制度缺陷，同并誓言将持续做出改善。 <br><br>
负责起诉违反知识产权行为的政府部门宣称 2012年共处理2347宗案件，比2011年增加了将近四成，这两年当中解决的案例金额高达20亿美元。 另外在江苏省，苏州市政府也正在其创新园区隔壁兴建一个面积50万平方米的机构，目的是要让知识产权相关单位与领先的科技公司比邻而居，以提高对知识产权问题的重视，同时强化专利审批与保扩的处理程序和质量。 <br><br>
尽管这些尝试属于地方政府，但也反映出保护知识产权的重要性逐渐受到重视。 <br><br>
尽管如此，盗窃知识产权的问题―包括组件和成品的逆向工程、仿冒和销售―仍让众多业者担忧，特别是跨国企业。中国黑客违背网络安全规定，在企业电脑网络上或跨越国境盗取高度机密信息的事件仍时有发生。微软全球资深副总裁张亚勤，同时也是该公司亚太研发集团主席兼中国研发实验室领导人认为，知识产权保障环境的提升将取决于“中国企业的需求”，因为随着中国企业逐渐取得技术开发的主导地位，就会开始要求保护这些技术。 <br><br>
有趣的是，我们也逐渐看到一些精明的中国企业开始有意识地努力保护自己。例如华为就制定了一系列规定来防止知识产权外泄。该公司目前已禁止在所属厂区使用非公司核发的个人电脑、移动装置和其他电子产品，更进一步限制任何笔记本电脑或智能手机进出厂区，因为担心这些设备可能存有敏感资料。此外，华为从事最机密研究的那幢大楼，不但不提供无线网络接入，电脑也都是固定在桌上，同时完全没有外部网络的连线。 <br><br>
另一些中国企业则开始对技术的掌握进行分级，只允许少数人对复杂的核心系统有完整的了解。同时，越来越多的企业禁止带有摄相机的仪器进入研发设施。许多企业也禁止使用便携式硬盘和优盘，因为它们可以用来进行电子传输。另外海尔也开始监控员工在技术平台上的活动，包括电子邮件和网页的浏览。 海尔和华为的经验显示，在不影响企业创新文化的前提下，建立强有力的防范机制是可行的。文化其实也是内部知识产权保护工作的关键要素之一。过去一年来，我们也看到越来越多的企业试图将知识产权变成内部的行为和道德规范的一部分，有时甚至规定要进行年度检讨，以及执行正式的员工签字流程。对跨国企业来说，这更是一大利好：因为员工若感受到因为自己是全球组织的一份子而受到高度重视，而不是为了帮助集团打进中国市场的一颗棋子，那么他们就更不会出卖公司的机密。 在防堵知识产权泄漏的过程中，不难想像许多跨国企业不经意地把中国团队孤立起来。但正如一位中国籍高管所言：“如果你要求中国员工忠诚，那么你应该先自问你对自己的员工又有多忠诚，毕竟相互尊重才能赢得员工的信任。” <br><br>
3. 开发新一代年轻人才 谈到中国的创新，一种普遍的看法是中国创新的产能（例如专利数量和研发设施的建设）大于能力―特别是针对中国人才库的质量而言。一些调研表明，时下年轻的大学毕业生具有显著的特征：教育程度高，家庭条件相对较好，比起进入私人企业，更愿意选择职业稳定的政府或国企。 我们并不质疑这些调研，但与我们见过的中国年轻企业家并不完全吻合。基于云技术的国双科技(Gridsum)的创始人、1984年出生岁的清华大学毕业生祁国晟，就是一个例子。<br><br>
从百度到可口可乐等跨国企业都是国双的客户，该公司去年更打败来自全球各地的企业，被微软视为最具创新能力的新软件伙伴。 暂时撇开创业圈不谈，我们在此要特别提出值得高层领导，特别是跨国企业的高层领导重视的另一种看法。一家中国企业的西方主管向我们表示，年轻员工和公司扩张的同步增长，对于企业文化和个人心态产生了很重要的影响。他的推论是，不论年轻人上班第一天是什么样的工作态度，这些刚离开大学或研究所踏入职场的年轻人，对于新的工作方式其实具有很高的可塑性。腾讯社交网络事业群总裁汤道生也有同感，他表示该公司偏好“在年轻人受到较不重视创新的中国企业文化影响之前”，直接从大专院校把人才挑出来。 <br><br>
再者，目前大学毕业生进入私人企业的人数也高于其他就业渠道。今天许多快速增长的企业也比八○和九○年代规模庞大的“第一批雇主”（其中有不少是一直到近期才私有化的国有企业）更有可能培养员工创新的习惯。简言之，受到中国大学的入学和毕业人数飚升的影响（1999年新生人数160万，2012年达到750万，同年毕业生人数也从100万增加到670万），中国的人才版图也随之改变。 但我们知道许多跨国企业似乎仍把重点放在寻找能帮助其快速将运营本地化的的资深人才，反而对培养下一代人才较不感兴趣，也不期待他们提出持续扩大业务的新点子。<br><br>
麦肯锡近期一项针对在中国运营的高科技公司（包括跨国企业）的调研表明，仅有17%的受访者表示在中国从事的是领先技术的研发活动。 与之相反的是联想等本土企业。联想首席科技执行官贺志强就表示，约有70%的新人是通过校园招聘。跨国企业自然应该拥抱年轻人才，但更重要的是，除非总部将创新的决策权转往中国，否则不太可能消除多年来的惯性。有志朝此方向努力的企业可以“围住”（ring fenced）一笔中国自主研发预算，同时将首席科技执行官或其他创新相关的高管职务长期派驻中国。 微软在这方面的成绩可圈可点。张亚勤骄傲地带领我们参观新成立的Azure育成中心，这是专门为新创公司提供的一项服务，帮助他们在创业初期应用Azure的云计算平台，其运作方式是由业务团队提出方案参加竞赛，获选的团队可以加入育成中心，然后会被分配到一名执行赞助人（an executive sponsor），并接受微软工程师的培训。<br><br>
此育成中心不只局限在云计算的领域；同时也是微软提高工程人才长期知名度的举措。而这似乎也看到回报。张亚勤在我们的参观过程中提到，微软目前可以在中国招聘的工程师，已经与总部所在的华盛顿州雷德蒙市可招聘的人数相当─这跟十年前的主流作法已不可同日而语。<br><br>

一如我们过去的判断，中国的创新模式和企业的创新突破形式，可能与欧美企业有很大的差异。中国更愿意直接从研发（一般基于已落实的客户订单）跳到制造和出货。因为绕过西方创新的传统流程―“创造、测试、修正、开发、生产、营销、销售”，而使得创新加速，同时也能迅速推出并扩大新业务规模。<br><br>
这一点许多跨国企业恐怕很难做到。我们经常听到这些企业的创新和产品经理谈到，为了使“立足中国、服务中国”不再流于一句口号，他们是如何与似乎永远走不完的步骤与层层关卡奋战的。 中国的模式自然也有其不足之处。我们已看到开发过程中出现质量事故、过度浪费，以及产量难以预测等问题。对本土企业而言，紧紧把握中国旺盛的创新活力，又能把握住大学、知识产权和人才最新趋势的企业将是未来的赢家，足以推出与欧美日韩抗衡的科技产品。 <br><br>

中国特色的社交媒体网络 中国有三亿多人使用社交媒体，活跃在博客、社交网站、微博和其他网络社区平台上。此外，中国网民40%的上网时间用于社交媒体。随着智能手机渗透率的提高，使用社交网络人数必然增加。2010年有1亿多移动网民，预计以每年30%的速度增长。 
中国社交媒体不仅覆盖广，社交网民还很活跃。微博上传发次数前五大用户，平均每人有100多万条转发信息，而推特才5000多条。2012年春节新 浪微博每秒发贴32,312条，比推特的最高纪录也才25,088条，显示出中国3亿网民的惊人能量。约76%的中国网民除了看贴，还积极发贴。美国积极 发贴的网民比例为25%。中国的微博故事比美国传播更快更广。 <br><br>
做好准备：建立社交安全网 建立社交安全网的关键在于，找到并培育网络意见领袖。西方消费者更加信任同伴推荐，而不是公司广告，中国的消费者也是这样，并且有过之而无不及。2008 年爆发了毒奶粉丑闻，中国消费者对广告产生了高度怀疑。社交媒体似乎有助于减少人们的怀疑。2011年温州高铁事故后，中国网民发了1000多万条微薄， 批评漏洞百出的安全标准和铁道部不透明的官僚作风。后来政府将每位受害者家庭的赔偿金从45万元提高到91.5万元。 大多数中国人怀疑来自正式渠道的信息，转而重视社交平台上消费者的意见。
由于消费者普遍的疑心，品牌需要找到能够影响社交网络用户对品牌感情的意见 领袖。发生负面消息后，这些人经常在保护或摧毁一个品牌中起到关键作用。虽然中国使用社交网络用户超过3亿，真正特别有影响力的意见领袖相对很少。 <br><br>
意见领袖分为三种类型：专家型（行业专家）；社交型（网络社区的管理者或版主）；草根型（某一品牌的忠实粉丝，并拥有大量跟随者）。如果危机的原因是对产品或品牌的误解，受网民信任的专家型意见领袖可以消除误解。 <br><br>
在危机发生之前，公司需要和这些意见领袖建立长期关系，为品牌建立强大的安全网络，在平时加深正面的品牌情感，在危机时帮助保护品牌。 网络危机传播很快，必须分秒必争。必须建立早期监测系统，做好准备。还需要建立一套危机处理指导原则，帮助你评估危机，并确保你的反应不会雪上加霜。 <br><br>
作出反应：尽早小心处理社交网络危机 危机发生后，首先寻求意见领袖的帮助。专家型意见领袖能够提供专业意见，有助于弄清事实，消除误解。社交型意见领袖能够帮助协调高度情绪化的网络讨论。而 草根型意见领袖能够讲述正面的个人品牌或产品体验，并明确表示继续使用品牌的意愿，从而保护品牌。在危机期间，需要积极和这些意见领袖保持沟通，并提供有 用、准确和真实的信息。同时谨慎行动，因为有些意见领袖可能对这一方式非常敏感。 <br><br>
你需要知道何时何地介入。社交媒体平台众多，微博用户一般占到负面发贴量的80%到90%。因此，品牌需要重点关注微博平台并作出反应。要知道，中 国社交媒体用户通常在早上10点到晚上7点转贴，这就是要采取行动的关键时间段。例如，让意见领袖转发出支持品牌的贴子。最后，转贴最活跃的时间是在发贴 后9分钟内。每贴的有效期很短，品牌需要在沟通时及时加入新的信息。 <br><br>
危机发生时会出现特别复杂的情况。很多公司定期使用“水军”，发布自己公司的正面消息，并用负面消息攻击竞争对手，希望更多人传播。有时某家公司的 负面报道，例如产品污染的指控，会引发竞争对手和其“水军”的无数微博。管理社交媒体危机时，公司应该通过跟踪历史记录，仔细找出谁是真的消费者和谁是被 雇佣的“水军”，他们一般比较活跃，非常负面，冷酷无情。不要理他们，他们不可能对你友善。重点是向那些真的消费者真诚地解释情况，对他们负面的评论作出 回应。 <br><br>
品牌：保持交流，真实沟通，重建品牌价值 风平浪静后，危机管理并没有结束。品牌恢复活动是提高消费者信息和重建品牌信赖度的关键。这需要不断培育意见领袖，监测社交网络活动找出问题迹象，并跟进消费者。 <br><br>
例如，在质量危机平息后，某一消费品品牌邀请主要意见领袖参观工厂，当面采访高管团队。该公司公开透明的态度影响很大，这些意见领袖在微博上发贴，正面准确地评价该公司的产品质量，通过网络传播，正面影响了数以千计的消费者。 经验丰富的公司知道，危机早晚都会爆发。根据中国社交网络情况，定制从危机准备、危机反应到危机恢复的项目，能够极大增强品牌控制危机的几率，并为长久的成功打好基础。 <br><br>

中国中产阶级的稳步增长带来了经济变革和消费转型，这一改变仍在继续。根据我们的估算，到2022年，将有超过75%的中国城市家庭年收入在6万―22.9万元人民币之间 ――相当于在购买力相同的情况下，收入处于意大利和巴西的平均之间。<br><br>
这一群体在生活必需品上的花费小于50%，而且其消费行为和消费习惯有别于其他阶层。上述定义的中产阶级在2000年仅占中国城市家庭的4%，而到2012年，这一数字已增长到了68%。在未来十年内，推动中国中产阶级家庭收入增长来自三大动力。首先，政府政策和劳动力市场的结构性变化有可能提高工资水平。其次，金融市场改革有可能进一步刺激就业增长，从而产生新增收入。其三，向民营企业开放更多的经济领域可鼓励劳动生产率的提高、降低成本和增加家庭收入 。<br><br>
假设上述情形得以实现，到2022年，中国城市家庭年收入将至少实现翻番。 <br><br>
上述宏观数字的背后是中国消费市场的巨变。自2005年以来，我们一直采用问卷调查和深入访谈的方式跟踪分析中国的消费群体 ，并依据其收入水平p年龄阶段p地理位置和购物习惯勾勒出中国消费者群谱图。我们近期的调查发现: 在新兴中产阶级之中，上层中产阶级即将成为今后十年带动消费支出上涨的重要引擎之一。与此同时，一批更加全球化思维的中国新生代将对市场产生巨大的影响; 中产阶级的增长在中国内陆小型城市的增长将快于东部沿海城市 ; 网络消费者的影响也将继续加大。<br><br>
要更多了解中国的电子商务。 “上层中产” 成为新主流群体 中产阶级迅速成为主体消费力量―― 他们的消费行为更精明和成熟，更愿意为产品品质支付溢价，并且非生活必需品的消费占比越来越大。为了方便研究，我们将中产阶级中家庭年收入介于10.6万―22.9万元人民币的群体称为‘上层中产阶级’，这在过去的研究被称为“新主流阶层” 。2012年，该阶层仅占所有城市家庭的14%，占比远不如“大众中产阶级” (家庭年收入为6万―10.6万元人民币)。<br><br>
而到2022年，我们估计上层中产阶级将占到城市家庭的54%，城市消费总额的56%；而大众中产阶级占比将下降到22%（见图1）。  <br><br>
<a href= "pic01.html">中产阶级统计（1）</a><br><br>

上层中产阶级的消费行为引领着中国未来的消费趋势。我们的研究表明，上层中产阶级更有可能购买笔记本电脑p数码相机等。据我们2012年的调查，56%的上层中产阶级购买了衣物柔软剂，而大众中产阶级仅有36%购买了该产品。除“富裕阶层”以外，上层中产阶级也推动着奢侈品消费的快速增长。过去4年，中国奢侈品境内消费市场激增，达到每年16%―20% 的增速。除去不可预见的因素，到2015年，全球高档手袋p鞋类p手表p珠宝和成衣的消费中，将有超过1/3来自中国内地。 <br><br>
G2独特的消费行为 中国的新中产阶级还分为几代人，其中最主要的一代我们叫做二代中产（G2）。到2012年，这一群体接近2亿人，占城市人口的15%。十年内，他们所占的消费份额将翻一番，达到35%。届时，中国G2的规模将是美国婴儿潮的近三倍。而婴儿潮一代正是多年来塑造美国消费市场的主体力量。 G2出生于1980年代中期以后、中国经济开始腾飞的时代，大多数是家中独生子女。他们的父辈经历过物资匮乏时期，消费心态比较保守。相比而言，G2自信、思想独立，其消费行为也体现了这种独立性。<br><br>
麦肯锡的研究显示，G2是思想 、行为“西化”的一代――他们认为贵的东西就是更好的，愿意尝试新的东西，追求品位和身份地位，忠诚于其所信赖的品牌，更青睐小众品牌。G2更加依赖互联网。在购买新的家电产品或个人数码用品之前，42%会上网查看他人的使用体验、评论或反馈。他们的父辈中仅有26%会这么做。（见图2） <br><br>


<a href= "pic02.html">中产阶级统计（2）</a><br><br>


根据我们的研究，G2对家庭购买决策起到了很大影响。虽然G2塑造着中国消费新格局，在他们身上还保留着上代人的某些价值观。他们的祖辈将传统的思维方式传递给了一代中产（G1）消费群，即生于1968年到1987年之间的人群。很多G2消费者也和父母或祖父母一样，偏爱储蓄，不愿意借贷，崇尚努力工作，他们以金钱、权力和社会地位来衡量一个人的成功。<br><br>
但是，传统价值观的延续并没有转化为与父辈类似的消费行为。就像G1一样，虽然他们忠诚于老品牌，但是比父辈更容易接受新思想。 内陆城市的崛起 2002年，当中产阶级还处于萌芽状态之时，其中大约40%生活在北京 、上海、广州和深圳这四个一线城市。这个比例到2022年将下降到16%（见图3）。中产阶级在一线城市的规模并没有萎缩，只是内陆小城市的中产阶级增长得更快。主要增量由三线城市所贡献，到2022年，这些城市的中产阶级家庭将占全国的30%以上，而在2002年这个比例仅为15%。<br><br>

<a href= "pic03.html">中产阶级统计（3）</a><br><br>

规模更小的四线城市正在迅速增长。吉林蛟河是位于中国东北部的内陆四线城市，地处东北亚经济区的交通中心，拥有丰富的自然资源，例如中草药和食用菌，而且也是中国葡萄酒和米酒重要的生产基地。2000年，该市7万户家庭中尚不足900户为中产家庭；到2022年，该市将增至16万户家庭，其中9万户，即60%左右跻身中产阶级。 甘肃省武威市 也是一个内陆四线城市，地处金昌――武威经济开发区内； 拥有丰富矿产资源（邻近的石墨烯和钛铁矿为全国最大），并且位于两条铁路及若干条高速公路的交通要道。2000年，全市8.7万户家庭中仅有900户为中产阶级。到2022年，预计全市65万户家庭中将有60%，即39万户为中产阶级。 <br><br>
**** 
快速崛起的中产阶级群体正在重塑着中国，这一态势在今后仍将持续。他们的购买力以及接受国内外新品牌的态度和敢于尝鲜的性格，对于全球企业意味着无穷的新商机。为充分把握该新兴消费群体，商界需要深入了解他们，并细致观察其消费行为如何演变。但是，许多企业过去成功的战略是建立在为大众消费者生产标准化产品并进行大规模分销的基础上，这在今天应该进行调整。新的市场环境是，成百上千万的中国消费者都在消费升级，对产品的期望值更高。<br><br>
面向未来，企业需要对消费者进行更细化的理解，不仅要知道他们在做什么，还要知道他们需求如何变化，以及这些变化的根本原因。掌握这些更深入的信息，企业便可以为日益成熟的消费者定制产品和服务组合，优化品牌架构来提供差异化产品，并为年轻消费者提供其所渴望的新鲜购物体验。这无疑是一项艰难挑战，但孕育着无限商机。 <br><br>

更富裕、更具个性，亦更趋成熟的消费者正在中国快速成长，给在华跨国企业带来了前所未有的机遇和挑战。机遇显而易见：根据世界银行购买力平价的定义，不出十年，超过3/4的中国城市家庭有望晋级中产。 <br><br>
但是市场迅速分化为大众中产，以及上层中产。后者的规模之大，影响之深，我们已经将其定义为“新主流阶级” 1 。他们一般居住在中国的沿海大城市，家庭年均可支配收入在106,000元和229,000元人民币之间（相当于17,000 至36,800美元）。他上层中产的消费选择和大众中产阶级截然不同 2。 新兴的上层中产规模持续扩大，到2020年之前超过一半的中国城市家庭将跻身上层中产，而在2012年仅为14%。这一趋势足以对当下的商业模式产生重大影响。那些长期以来凭借低价来满足消费者基本要求的企业将面临难关，并可能失去几百万升级的消费者。 既要服务熟悉但增长趋缓的大众市场，又要进军不确定性和潜力并存的上层中产，这需要企业进行创新。本文将着重讨论消费类企业应打造吸引中产阶级的品牌，制定双重战略和过渡方案，并培养应对复杂环境的竞争能力。 <br><br>
1. 情感纽带 长期以来，中国消费者对市场并不真正了解，往往只关心商品的基本功能，他们非常务实。到目前为止，也只有德芙巧克力和星巴克通过强大的情感营销，强调尽情享受巧克力或咖啡休闲体验，从而大获成功。中国的消费者似乎尚未做好准备。 2010年时，我们研究的40种消费品类别中，功能性几乎是唯一的关键购买因素。才过了两年，情感因素的重要性就大大提升―甚至是排在前两位。以购买洗发香波品类考虑情感因素为例，中上端消费者比大众消费群高出50%。 瑞典爱生雅（SCA）是一家个人卫生用品和林业公司。该公司以通用的的消费者路演将面巾产品的基本功能性优点展示给中国大众消费者。同时，爱生雅还希望塑造成令中高端消费者憧憬，且价格合宜的高端产品，这也是该公司在更发达的香港市场采用的策略。“我们的目标客户是年轻的白领职业女性”，爱生雅公司北亚卫生产品事业部总裁Stephan Dyckerhoff表示， “我们希望她们就像炫耀苹果手机那样炫耀我们的产品。” 为此，爱生雅致力于加强消费者和产品之间的情感纽带。其中一招就是在卡拉OK 包房里供应小包装纸巾，以此在目标客户的爱好之间建立情感纽带。如此聪明的方法如能实施，大有希望成为竞争激烈市场中的差异化因素。越来越多的领先公司也开始使用类似招数，升级门店，借力于口碑相传(包括越来越多消费者用来交换想法的社交媒体平台) ，以确保自家产品成为中国新一代消费者的购买选项。3 <br><br>
2. 双重战略 立志高远的品牌在中国新兴上层中产阶级心中已占据一席。“新兴中上层中产带来的机遇就是我们的未来，” 联合利华北亚事业部负责人Alan Jope认为，“这个群体引领所有产品类别，甚至比奢侈品消费者更加重要。” 虽然如此，但联合利华和其他领先公司仍然相信大众消费市场的地位。 “中国沿海地区的消费者可能更加富裕，正在提高消费档次。”箭牌口香糖亚太区总裁Michael Yeung 认为， “但是内陆城市仍将是巨大的市场。” 一些富有远见的公司开始开始着手制定双重战略: 以销量为目标的大众市场业务模式，以及以追求利润为目标的上层中产业务模式。实际运营中，这一战略经常和地理区域配合开展: 大型区域分解小的地区、每个地区制定各自的产品组合、定价、营销策略和执行计划。最成熟的企业为每个区域制定了清晰的损益责任，并意识到销量、价值、成本控制和利润的相对重要性将充满变数。 一家知名糖果制造商通过这一战略，为大众市场开发了相对便宜的入门级产品，并为愿意提升消费层次的客户提供高利润产品。为了尽量减少产品之间的相互蚕食，公司规定入门级产品的销售只限于居民收入水平较低的内陆城市，，且仅限于当地的传统夫妻老婆店。 
4 这样低端产品不会出现在销售高端产品的现代零售店。该公该公司不仅关注分销: 为了打击灰色市场，公司员工定期走访零售网点，检查货架，使用扫描码核实商品产地和归属。违反规则的分销商首先会被警告，如继续违规则中止合作。 与此同时，公司将较为昂贵的产品留给沿海发达城市，精心设计营销活动和产品包装，吸引更加成熟，更有想法的消费者。他们把品尝昂贵零食当作犒赏自己。在过去的三年，该公司的中国区总营收每年增加15%。表现在内陆城市主要增长销量，而沿海城市则带来利润。 拜耳医药保健公司采用了类似做法。该公司近期拓宽了在中国小城市的销售和分销网点，并在28个大城市增加销售人员，希望更好地为新兴上层中产服务。 <br><br>
3. 严格的时间表 时间是双重战略成功的关键因素。企业必须了解不同地区发生变化的性质，并抢先竞争对手行动。但是又不能过太快，否则大众市场会受到冲击。这一切都需要严格的规定。 一家全球性食品制造商制定的双重战略时间表非常严密，值得借鉴。高管层首先基于消费者收入和偏好，以及竞争对手的行动，将其细分为40个区域微群（geographic microcluster）。然后，公司主要产品组对这些微群进行了详细研究，根据各自发展状况― 完全大众市场、开始转型，还是快速升级―― 对其进行组合。最后，对各种建议方案逐一评估。更进一步找出产品的使用差异。<br><br>
例如，某微群正在快速升级到使用香波，但是肥皂的使用还没有升级迹象。 该公司对大众市场微群的策略没有变化。对第二个类别(开始转型)的市场营销计划，在未来的12到24个月内，推出更多高端品牌和产品。对于快速升级的消费者，公司加快了节奏: 新品牌和新单品的窗口期缩短到6至9个月，并不断推出促销以提高平均价格。为了防止被竞争对手打乱阵脚，公司建立竞争情报小组，走遍全国收集信息，并和销售团队合作，协调合适的对应措施。当竞争对手的新产品和策略开始影响到过渡计划时，公司能够迅速调整转型速度，挫败对手，避免丢失市场份额。 快速的适应能力是公司战略成功的关键，取得了令人瞩目的业绩: 在过去三年，年销量增长12%到15%；营业收入增长15%到20%。而且息税前利润（EBIT）提升显著，说明此策略取得效果。 这个例子有力地说明，当作出战略决策时，时机和地域经常相互关联。
某跨国个人护理公司的身体护理产品部就是一个很好的例子。<br><br>
公司意识到华北地区为较低收入的大众市场，消费者的偏好相差很大，传统的肥皂有很大市场。与此同时，公司加大营销攻势，让新兴上层中产喜欢高利润的洗衣液。不同的是，华南的大众消费者已经青睐液体皂。当消费者更加富裕，该公司则向他们宣传放弃便宜的本地品牌。 最后一步是确定最合适的全国营销渠道。在北京和类似开封、洛阳和郑州的内陆城市，中央电视台和其他全国性电视台的影响依然很大。上海消费者偏好本地和省级的电视台，以及新媒体，例如出租车的液晶电视广告。 <br><br>
4.营销革新 实施复杂、时效性强的双重策略需要强大的市场营销能力。多个接触点不仅重要，而且越来越数字化。营销有创新是关键并且寻求在大众群体和新兴中产的个性化需求中取得平衡。 耐克公司多年来持续投放电视广告，其代言的体育明星出现在城市随处可见的户外广告牌上。不久前，耐克公司首次在中国最流行的移动通信平台―― 微信上展开营销活动。<br><br>
为扩大用户兴趣，耐克还在出租车、户外海报和其他醒目地点大量使用二维码5 。拥有3亿多用户的微信平台能够帮助耐克和主流客户深化交流。用户体验互动活动向_高端消费者传递了更多的个性化意识。 <br><br>
营销革新需要深入了解客户，随着上层中产阶层的扩大和其要求的提升，这一点显得尤其重要。一家全球食品和饮料制造商在中国六个区域建立“消费者洞察中心”，试图在变化的客户偏好和行为中占到先机。与此类似，宝洁公司的北京研究中心模拟了胡同，由窄窄的巷子和传统四合院构成。宝洁公司模拟胡同的研究人员观察消费者刷牙、换尿布、并据此对产品做出改动。一如公司总部俄亥俄州辛辛那提市模拟婴儿活动房中研究人员所做的。<br><br>
在北京的研发中心，研究人员在模拟的超市货架上摆满了竞争对手的产品，以此探究消费者的购买方式。 社交媒体是越来越重要的一个来源。例如，欧莱雅于2006年推出了兰蔻玫瑰在线社区，提供中国女性交换美容信息，寻求专业人士意见，目前有将近100万名会员，很多是活跃会员。2011年，约2/3的会员每天至少访问一次。一半以上的讨论话题有超过五条的客户留言。这一平台不仅充当了营销工具，还是该公司宝贵的信息来源。 尽管科技和数据发挥着日益重要的作用，但它们永远不能取代创新，创新是智慧营销的核心。最近爱生雅发起一项活动，鼓励中国消费者对面巾纸空盒子发挥创意，以表现产品和资源可持续发展的联系。最终获胜者受邀参观位于瑞典总部公司的森林，参观公司如何以可持续的方式植树，作为产品的原材料。这项试验性营销很快吸引了一家中国电视台，遂派记者随获奖者到瑞典采访报道，最终播出了两个小时的纪录片。活动的结果大大超出了公司对营销最乐观的预期。<br><br>

有些工厂关门是因为其所属的企业破产，有些则是因为公司决定迁往内地。例如鞋商Guangzhou Constant就在优惠税率和低15%至20%的薪资成本的吸引下，将制造基地迁往湖南永州。同样，去年在河南郑州开设新厂的富士康，也将上千个工作从 广东迁走。跨国企业如美国的Coach，也计划在未来五年将大部分的生产基地从广东(及中国)迁往越南和印度等其他国家。<br><br> 
这股外迁趋势象征着广东作为中国25年来外贸制造重镇所面临的长期挑战。<br><br>
广东省能够维持一直以来的成长趋势，还是会像密歇根一样，在脱胎换骨转型之前就失去了制造业的基础? 数据会说话。2000年以前，广东在中国的出口占比高达37%，但至2011年已经下跌至28%。该省的出口增长率在2010年为26%，而2011年的 前9个月则降至22%，且仍在持续萎缩中。结果广东的农民工在2005到2010年之间，以每年3%的速度减少。唯一的正面影响就是该省的经济开始变得多 元化，2005年出口在广东省GDP占比还高达85%，到了2010年已经降至66%。 广东政府许多官员相信该省有充裕的能力可以抵御这股变化。2008年在明确了广东地方经济的弱点后，广东省政府出台了一项通过发展珠江三角洲实现广东经济转型的计划。 <br><br>
这些官员相信制造商的缱呋崽诔鐾恋兀有利于商业与住宅不动产的发展，进而促进该省的城市化进展。(他们乐观的假设广东土地并未受到有毒物质的污染以至于不适合居住。) 地方官员也声称，许多工厂其实只给广东带来非常微薄的价值――仅支付最低税率，创造的就业机会也十分有限。这些工厂的关闭与迁移对就业造成的影响其实微乎其微――只是那些占广东总人口35%且经济贡献率只有25%的农民工受到影响。<br><br>

官员们也表示，工厂的迁移只会使社会更加团结，因为农村地区会努力填补其在收入、发展水平和教育程度上的差距。事实上，广东省政府已经计划循序渐进将该省经济转向以现代制造业 (也就是向更注重研发与技术密集度更高的行业靠拢)以及服务业为主。 但广东是否真能在目前的制造业根基丧失之前完成转型，还很难说。<br><br>
广东的压力显而易见。随着它在中国外贸行业的重要性日渐下滑，国外投资也开始减少。1990年代广东省的外国直接投资年增长率达24%，但之后每年仅增加5%，而全中国的平均增长率则为10%。 在技术性较低的制造业外迁之后，广东需要训练有素的技术劳动力加入较先进的行业部门。但广东似乎不具备这样的人才。只有9%的广东人口有大学学历，相较于全国平均的10%还略低一筹。也因此广东没有足够的人才能够加入政府优先鼓励的行业，如制药、高新科技和再生能源。 此外，该省15岁以下的人口占比已经从2000年的25%降至17%。这意味着未来十年加入劳动力大军的年轻人将减少，政府必须将年纪较大的劳动力转往低端的服务行业，并提供他们大量的培训。但是劳动力的年纪越大，培训起来就越困难。 <br><br>
广东也许能安然度过波动的全球经济，但能否在中国经济的结构性转型中维持增长，则仍未有定论。 <br><br>

为什么通用汽车和大众汽车在中国比本田和丰田更成功？ 岩谷直行，欧高敦，Brian Salsberg<br><br>
尽管有不少日本的大型知名企业在国际上大获成功，但仍有许多企业在一些最重要的市场上落后于其全球竞争对手。为什么通用汽车和大众汽车在中国比本田和丰田更成功？为什么LG和三星在印度比松下和索尼更强大？为什么IBM在日本比富士通在美国生意做得更大？ 这些问题并不只是学术探讨。<br><br>

对于许多日本企业而言，能否继续生存，可能将取决于它们大幅提高海外收入和利润的能力，因为人口状况和经济趋势表明，日本国内市场的增长将会放慢或停滞。即使是拥有成熟全球业务的日本企业，也面临着日益激烈的竞争，必须更新其海外业务模式。 为了打造一个全球化企业，许多日本高管需要以全新的、不熟悉的方式来思考组织机构、市场营销和战略等问题。一些过去被证明是成功的方法――例如，在国外运营中复制在日本市场的做法――已经失去了其有效性。 好消息是，沉睡的巨人――日本公司――已经开始醒来。国际兼并和收购与日俱增，董事会的讨论有了新的紧迫感，而且，一些更勇于进取的日本企业采取了 一些大胆举动――采用英语作为全球工作语言，以及招聘有才干的非日本籍高管。<br><br>
尽管如此，就大多数开始觉醒的企业而言，变革的步伐仍然迟缓，往往采取一些投 机取巧、杂乱无章而并非战略性的做法。 生存问题 在过去十年中，日本一些最大企业的相对市场份额一直在不断丧失：在1995～2009年期间，日本企业在“财富全球500强”总收入中所占的比例从 35％下降到了13％。例如，电子产品是日本具有长期优势的产品门类之一，但是，根据日本经济贸易和产业省的统计，日本在全球电子产品出口值中所占的份额 已从上世纪90年代的30％下滑到今天的不足15％。<br><br>
许多日本企业都没有选择全球化，即使它们也希望继续保持增长。 <br><br>
不断萎缩的消费群体和日益落后的生产率 在过去40年中，日本企业通过主导其国内市场，获得了全球领导地位，但好景不再。到2040～2050年，预计日本的人口将从今天的1.27亿下降 到不足1亿。人口的不断减少几乎肯定会降低私人消费的绝对水平以及税收，并潜在降低GDP总额。2008年底，日本的私人消费为220万亿日元（2.7万 亿美元），占GDP的59％。到2040年，按照人均GDP绝对增长率超过50％的基本假设――在目前通货紧缩的环境下，增长率很难预测，（乐观地）预测 私人消费将达到293万亿日元。 另一个经济问题是日本国内日益落后的生产率。尽管也有少数世界一流的行业和企业，但日本仍然跻身于主要发达国家中劳动生产率最低的国家之列。因此， 日本企业通常比较缺乏竞争力，而且更容易在国内受到外国竞争者的冲击。日本企业的员工往往是世界上最勤奋的员工，但他们无论作为集体，还是作为个人，工作 效率都比较低――尤其是那些在工厂不努力工作的人。<br><br>
我们与一些高管人员的交谈表明，日本经理人已敏锐地意识到，他们的总部机构臃肿、人浮于事；员工更多地 关注工作本身，而不是其效果或结果；此外，由于日本企业限制将一些与IT相关的职能外包和离岸运营，也妨碍了效率的提高。 外国竞争者的冲击 与此同时，外国竞争者利用日本消费者对数字商务的热情，以及对外国产品新的开放心态，已经渗入了曾经封闭的日本市场。在许多方面，这些消费者渴望标 新立异，其行为越来越像欧洲和美国的消费者：他们追求的是价值。在日本的社会背景下，价值就意味着产品的外观具有吸引力或新潮时尚，但其价格却比传统产品 低廉得多。 除了少数例外，日本的企业却迟迟没有提供这种价值，这就给了外国竞争者――尤其是那些对产品分销具有强大控制力的企业――一个打入市场的机会。<br><br>
一些 企业通过提供某些价值与令人兴奋的购物体验的组合（好市多、H＆M、宜家、Zara），或者提供一种朴素的、直观的用户体验（亚马逊、苹果），吸引了世界 各地的消费者。另一些企业（如沃尔玛）利用自己的全球足迹，避开了日本的多层分销体系，从而以大大低于日本竞争产品的价格，推出自己的产品。虽然外国竞争 对手总的市场份额仍然很小，但其增长速度通常远远超过了规模更大的日本竞争对手。 一种陈旧的创新模式 日本企业曾经是为发达国家市场消费者提供具有吸引力的创新产品的领头羊。但是，快速增长的新兴市场消费者却有着不同的需求。日本已经发现，试图在国 内的研发实验室确定这些需求――这是一种典型做法――是一个挑战。这个问题并不仅仅与新兴市场有关，日本企业必须在所有市场上都更贴近自己的客户。<br><br>
目前， “日本制造”模式存在不足之处。 事实上，新兴的企业创新模式是利用来自世界各地的产品创意、客户洞见、资金和人才，在全球范围内进行协作。例如，宝洁公司报告说，其50％以上的创 新举措都涉及与外界的协作。资生堂的高管人员表示，他们无法设想该公司的所有创新――无论是美容产品创新，还是销售渠道创新――都来自日本；因此，该公司 2010年斥资17亿美元，收购了总部设在美国的Bare Escentuals公司。是什么原因使日本传统的、基于实验室的研发活动如今变得事倍功半呢？简言之，是因为来自中国、韩国和台湾地区的竞争日趋激烈； 获得产品零部件的渠道日益拓宽；以及产品上市的速度越来越快。 在研究和开发上的投资往往被视为创新的代理指标，诚然，日本是研发活动的领头羊，用于研发的开支占到GDP的3.8％。<br><br>
但是，这种看法忽略了至关重 要的一点：许多曾经由日本主导的产品门类的创新如今都来自其他国家。在美国的全国制造商协会发布的一份2010年度报告中，将新加坡和韩国列为世界上创新 能力最强的两个国家――远远领先于日本，甚至领先于排名第8的美国。 走向全球 考虑到许多日本企业具有的制造和技术实力，以及庞大的整体规模，它们完全应该成为全球领军企业。但它们并没有做到这一点。为了更好地了解日本企业的 全球化状况，我们对16个行业中每个行业最大的10家日本企业进行了分析。平均而言，在其中15个行业中（汽车行业是一个明显的例外），如果用在日本以外 的收入、资产和拥有股票所占的百分比来衡量，10家最大的日本企业的全球化程度都要低于其海外同行。按照这些衡量指标，从2006年到2009年，日本企 业的全球化步伐几乎停滞不前。<br><br> 
平均值并不能反映全部事实，即使按照这些标准来衡量，有些日本企业的全球化程度也相当高。但是，对于大多数日本企业而言，全球化仍然是一项正在进行中的工作。麦肯锡在日本的经验表明，为了成功地实现全球化，日本企业应当在组织机构、市场营销和企业战略上采取五个步骤。 给出企业全球化的理由 许多日本企业都了解全球化的好处。但它们的高管可能缺少一个能令员工信服的“全球化故事”――全球化目标、愿景和价值主张。能以一种可以激发和振奋 整个组织，同时又可以消除伴随发展方向的巨大变革而产生的焦虑情绪的方式，使这些“全球化故事”得到广泛的理解和恰当的传达吗？<br><br>
为创制这种讯息而花费的时 间和精力可能看似价值不大，但如果没有全体员工的共同参与，企业全球化的努力就不会深入持久。 资生堂说明了一个成功案例的某些特性。<br><br>
例如，该公司高管人员必须以一种使其对其他员工意味深长的方式，来讲解“全球化故事”。当资生堂公司的前田晋 三（现为该公司董事长）于2005年成为首席执行官时，他将全球化作为企业最重要的优先任务。前田不断提醒员工，不要忘记公司的愿景：“成为一家源于日 本、代表亚洲的全球性企业”。这种定位阐明了该公司的总体战略――通过一次大规模收购和建立全球轮岗计划增强企业实力――但并不削弱本土市场的重要性。 高管人员应该清楚地了解企业独特的优势和能力，并确保它们成为其全球战略的组成部分。对于资生堂来说，这些优势和能力意味着培训和技术。该公司每年 都要培训数千名美容顾问，并在中国、俄罗斯和美国采取了同样的做法。虽然许多资生堂产品在国外并不采用该企业的品牌名称，大部分是作为日本的研究和技术成 果销售。 高管人员强硬――有时不那么受欢迎――的行为可能会支持这种说法。在担任最高管理职务后，前田放弃了一些规模较小、历史悠久的品牌，同时，对一些全 球性大品牌加倍投资，提高其市场地位，使其成为在日本国内和国外同类产品的领军品牌，虽然他也为本地品牌留下了发展空间。他还聘请了一位经验丰富的外国人 Carsten Fischer来管理资生堂的国际业务，现在，国际业务已占到该公司收入的40％以上。Fischer通过拒绝搬进公司分配的办公室，而是选择与其他员工 一起在开放的小隔间中办公，证明了他希望自己成为日本管理团队的一部分。 采用英语作为企业工作语言 采用英语作为企业的主要工作语言可能会引起争议，而且很难执行。<br><br>
但它在全球化努力中的重要性无论怎样强调也不过分，对于单一文化的日本企业来说，尤 其如此。我们的经验表明，用英语来管理企业的大部分业务和进行内部交流的决策，是跨国公司（如法国的达能公司和以色列的Teva制药工业公司）全球化努力 获得成功的一个重要因素。 <br><br>
使用英语的举措至关重要，因为它开辟了招揽人才的新领域。在全球化进程中，所有其他事情都取决于能够利用更高质量的员工人才库。如果不采用一种国际 商业通用语言，就很难实现人才跨业务单元和跨地区的频繁交流。虽然讲其他语言的企业文化可能会令人不太愉快，但使用英语的趋势是不可阻挡的――差不多有 10亿人将英语作为自己的第一语言或第二语言。<br><br>

具有全球抱负的亚洲人才往往会学习英语，而不是日语或俄语。 日本企业将如何采用英语？这是一个大问题。<br><br>
## 中国觉得英语足够好了，高考不用比英语了？？！<br><br>

2009年，在国际货币基金组织的所有先进经济体中，日本的托福考试（TOEFL，为想去美国学习的外国学生提供的英语能力测试）成绩得分最低。而在亚洲国家中，日本的托福得分排名倒数第二，仅仅超过老挝1。 <br><br>
尽管如此，一些日本企业（如乐天和优衣库）已经宣布，到2012年，它们将把英语作为自己企业的工作语言，而日产汽车和武田公司也用英语举行了多次会议。 如果一些名校（如东京大学）或一些领先的日本企业将优良的英语成绩作为录取或聘用的先决条件，我们可以想象，日本的总体英语能力将会迅速提高。 设计一种积极进取的人才管理战略 典型的日本企业高管从未承担过国际性任务，或在自己的公司或业务单元以外的地方工作过。几乎所有的高管人员都是日本人。这种专业人士可能相当擅长管 理国内业务，但对于在快速变化的竞争性市场上运营全球性企业，却越来越感到力不从心、底气不足。日本企业正在痛苦地意识到这种障碍。<br><br>
2010年日本政府对263名高管人员的一次调查发现，全球化的最大障碍是“在日本保障和培训人力资源。” 一般来说，日本企业的人力资源模式非常有利于国内业务，但却不适合国际业务。日本人才管理的明显特点众所周知：基于资历的晋升、平均主义的薪酬，以及终身雇佣制。人力资源职能部门的关注重点几乎完全集中在大学层面的招聘，以及使按部就班、基于资历的晋升制度顺利运转。 国际经验对于职务晋升不仅不是必要条件，而且往往被视为一种负面影响。日本企业通常具有单一的文化，只使用一种语言，从而使外国人很难在这种环境中 获得成功。<br><br>
此外，妇女很难获得晋升：根据世界经济论坛的2010年性别差距指数，日本在134个国家中排名第94位。在高收入国家中，只有韩国的排名比日 本更低。 大多数日本企业都需要重新反思人力资源部门的作用，并采用一种纳入了新的职场路径、薪酬和绩效评价方法的雇用战略。一些企业（如小松集团和资生堂） 正一马当先、引领变革，但其他企业却进展缓慢。采用最佳做法的人才管理方案在企业的所有层级都实行任人唯贤、唯才是举的晋升制度，并强调人才的多样性。它 们将人才管理提升到战略高度，以吸引最优秀的人才，并为他们安排合适的工作岗位，而不仅仅是填补职位空缺。为了提升日本企业的人才管理水平，以下是它们可 以采取的一些基本措施： 接受多样性，为妇女、外国人和来自其他企业和行业的日本经理人设立愿景目标。<br><br>
我们并不推荐采用某种名额分配制度，但如果没有具体目标，就没有一种指导人力资源部门或跟踪进度的方式。 制定一项面向前100～200名高管的全球轮岗计划，使他们能到该企业在国外的其他部门工作。该计划应保证轮岗高管原来的职级不变，并将升职条件与参与轮岗挂钩。全球化和类似的战略性计划可以帮助提高高管群体的能力，并丰富他们的经验。 使人力资源部门在人才战略和人才培养上承担更多责任，而不只是负责在企业内部安排工作和进行招聘。这种职责包括：制定一项内容广泛的领导力培养计划，并为管理人员的训导工作提供支持。 例如，小松集团有自己的内部管理培训计划。<br><br>
由本地高管人员管理该公司在一些主要国家的大部分运营，而且员工们知道，海外经验提供了一条快速晋升的路 径。事实上，在日本的小松集团高管中，超过2/3的人都有过具有针对性的海外工作经历。资生堂也加入了日产汽车和索尼公司的行列，聘请了一位外国人担任其 顶级高管，负责管理国际业务，并制定了一项在日本率先实施的“不升职就离职”政策：如果管理人员在一定的时间内不能升职，他们将被要求离职。 建立一个全球营销职能部门 近年来，日本的消费品生产企业在将其技术和制造能力转化为品牌资产和为国外消费者量身打造的产品时步履维艰。事实上，它们在尝试了解消费者上所花的 时间太少，并且往往与它们希望获取份额的市场缺乏联系。日本一些最大的消费品企业的许多高管私下承认，他们在努力确保以顾客为中心，而不是以研发实验室为 中心的产品开发中，已经落后于像苹果、宝洁、三星和联合利华这样的外国企业。 <br><br>
一些知名度很高的日本企业缺少适当的营销职能部门，它们认为，有一个产品开发小组、一支销售团队，以及与日本一流广告公司的一纸合同就足够了。但 是，这种做法已经过时了。产品开发步伐的不断加快――造成了产品、价格和销售渠道的同质化――使市场营销和打造品牌比以往任何时候都更重要。例如，在苹果 公司推出其iPad仅仅半年后，三星电子就在2010年11月推出了Galaxy Tab平板电脑。 世界一流的营销组织有几个共同特点：在创新和产品开发流程中，全球营销起到了重要作用；提供稳定一致的客户体验；能够吸收来自其他行业或市场的洞 见；以及利用先进技术更好地了解消费者的需求。<br><br>
一些日本企业（如任天堂和丰田）同时拥有强大的全球品牌和发达的营销能力，但这些企业只是一些例外。 当拥有品牌的企业具有独特的价值主张，并希望有效地将其传达给从战略上选择的客户细分群体时，品牌能使它们获益非浅。但是，品牌管理的理念却与大部 分日本消费品企业格格不入。每个业务单元和地区分公司都倾向于将品牌控制在自己的地盘内，而这有时会导致品牌的特征或体验不一致。2010年，只有5家日 本企业入选“全球最具价值品牌100强”（WPP BrandZ Top 100），这是一项基于全球上百万消费者的投票而确定的品牌年度排名。这些日本品牌在上榜企业所创造的品牌总资产中所占的比例还不到5％。 <br><br>
在已经创建了庞大品牌资产的大多数全球性企业中，最重要的营销决策都是由首席执行官（相当于一个自主业务单元的负责人）做出，或者由某个直接向该组 织最高决策者报告的人（如首席营销官）做出。在这些企业中，正是由首席营销官对全球营销与本地营销之间的平衡，对各种上市渠道之间的折衷权衡，以及对向新 的广告媒体投入多少资金做出最终决定。然而，在收入超过10亿美元的日本企业中，只有不到1％的企业设有首席营销官，而在规模相当的美国企业中，这一比例 超过了10％。例如，我们可以发现，在日本最大的12家饮料制造商中，只有一家拥有向首席执行官报告工作的独立营销组织。<br><br>
一家具有全球化愿景的日本企业如何才能变得真正以品牌导向？ 决定首席营销官的职位应获得哪些权力，以及他在组织结构中应处于什么位置。至少在全球品牌资产的思维方式成为一家企业的习惯之前，首席营销官在所有关键决策的讨论中，必须拥有超出常规的发言时间。 招聘与品牌价值目标相适应的市场营销人才。必须在关键职位上安排对全球营销洞见与对日本文化同样驾轻就熟的员工。为了引入新的替代思维方式，有必要从其他行业或地区招聘市场营销人才。 为全球业务单元和品牌“拥有者”重新分配权力。矩阵组织结构是那些国内管理人员与全球品牌和业务单元拥有者分 享权力的企业组织的特征，这种结构确实面临挑战。但是，将所有决策权都下放给特定的地区分公司，也不太可能创建成功的全球业务。营销人员越来越倾向于确定 跨越国界的消费典型“群落”。每种消费典型都包括类似的产品和品牌。同时，互联网日益强大的威力已迫使企业在全球范围内协调营销信息。<br><br>
对于日本企业来说， 转向一种看起来更像是世界领先的全球消费品企业做法的营销模式是值得的，即使这会造成短期的痛苦，而且，这样做可能会提升他们的全球品牌资产。 从企业战略性发展中更多获益 任何严肃认真的全球化尝试将必然导致更多的并购、合资和结盟，以及更多地利用其他扩张模式。很明显，日本企业将不得不在这个舞台上积极采取行动，因为在许多市场中，内涵式增长虽然很重要，但它并不能提供竞争所需要的规模。 日本企业并不回避进行海外交易。事实上，并购活动最近已有所增加，这部分是因为日元走强，以及他们日益认识到，日本国内市场正在不断萎缩。近年来， 一些单独的交易已经证明是成功的。<br><br>
但是，只有少数日本企业尝试并完成了连续收购战略，如思科系统和宝洁公司的连续收购，被认为是这一领域的典范。一家正尝 试这样做的企业是乐天公司――日本一流的在线购物网站，它在一年时间内，在中国、法国、印度尼西亚和美国完成了一系列交易。 除了并购以外，许多企业还尝试了建立相互交易、少数合资和组成联盟等合作关系。<br><br>
一般来说，这些做法的结果都令人失望，这部分是因为它们既不能打造能 力，也不能帮助企业分享最佳做法；充其量，它们只是提供了一种国际收入流，或进入新市场的基本渠道。事实上，许多日本跨国公司更像是一些国际子公司的控股 公司，而不像真正的全球性组织。它们收购企业后，除了合并收入以外，只进行最小限度的整合――无视削减成本的机会，雇用被收购企业的优秀员工，以及确定其 最好的产品，并将其全球化。<br><br>
在某些情况下，日本的收购方甚至发现，自己收购了这些具有竞争性利益企业的少数权益，但对目标企业如何增长却无能为力。 日本企业高管向我们表达了对这种合并后管理不力的挫败感，这往往源于语言不通和其他文化障碍。我们知道有不止一家日本企业进行了海外收购，然后向被收购企业的总部派出一个团队，但由于沟通困难和对如何分享最佳做法缺乏清晰概念，只能无功而返。 我们观察到，一些企业试图通过试验与其核心业务明显不同的一些业务模式，来实现全球化。在一种方法中，日本企业创造了一个“第二故乡”，它提供了摆 脱公司总部各种束缚的自由――意味着有更多空间来进行全面试验，以及摆脱本土市场的偏见进行决策。日本总部现行的业务运行仍然保持不变，而管理人员可以与 总部共享在“第二故乡”学到的经验教训。<br><br>
高管们可以通过重组企业，以消除国内与国外市场之间的区别，收购一项外国业务，并用它进行试点和试验，以及把一个 业务部门迁移到外国，来创建一个“第二故乡”。 松下电器正朝着这一方向前进。在2010年年底，其总裁大坪文雄宣布，该公司将在其消费电子产品的营销业务中，消除国内与全球市场之间的区别。这一 决定是在该公司唯一的日本国内品牌“National”退市，以及重新将其努力重点放在为新兴市场开发物美价廉产品两年后做出的。小松集团是世界上第二大 建筑设备制造商（仅次于卡特彼勒公司），它不是在东京总部对其业务单元的运营计划进行年度审核，而是分别在该公司8个主要市场的每一个进行这项工作，以彰 显这些市场的重要性。 日本企业逐步国际化的另一种方式是与国内竞争对手组成合资企业。<br><br>
在许多情况下，由于成本高、规模小，或者缺乏驾驭国外市场的经验，这些企业无法竞标 海外项目，因此，它们可以考虑采取协作方式。我们发现越来越多采用这种方式的例子，包括日立和三菱重工签订协议，合作在海外市场建设铁路系统。 全球化只是达到目的的一种手段。最终的目标是要创建和维系一种利润增长与价值创造的自我强化循环，获得更丰 富的资产和人才储备，并为员工和投资者提供一种更具吸引力的价值主张。要实现这些目标有很多困难。许多日本企业必须实行重大变革，但大多数企业在开始全球 化进程时都具有相当大的优势：企业规模，在本土市场的相对优势，强大的质量标准和服务能力，以及适应老龄化和对数字技术经验丰富的人口的工作经验。在撰写 本文时，日本企业还拥有适合进行国际交易的坚挺货币。 <br><br>
尽管如此，对于大多数日本企业高管来说，前进的道路似乎困难重重，可以形象地 比喻为，站在岸边眺望大洋彼岸的世界，而这个世界的语言他们很多人都不会说，这个世界的习俗和成功的行为方式似乎与他们自己的完全不同。即使他们已经得出 结论，自己企业的一些事物必须变革，但要设想如何使自己的组织走上新的发展方向，可能也相当困难。我们认为，最便捷的路径就是，通过确保在未来几年中，让 更快实现全球化成为一项最重要的优先任务，“将企业的航船驶入全球化的潮流之中”。 <br><br>

日本正在经济竞争中失利。为何该国不能从自己的错误中汲取教训？ Tadashi Yanai<br><br>





日本最大的问题是保守和胆小。<br><br>
我们希望稳定、无忧无虑和安全。但是，世界在不停地变化。其他国家在发展，而我们日本却在故步自封。 问题之一是我们小看了发展中国家。如果这些国家比我们强，我们应该愿意向这些国家的企业学习。但是，我们却缺乏学习的意愿，因为我们曾经取得过巨大的成功。我们企业的管理人员和员工都存在这样的问题。 另一个问题是日本的业务人员和企业都缺乏个性。有太多的人认为，所有人都必须是一样的。这是一个根本性的错误。 最后，日本的企业似乎总在反思回顾。他们变得喜欢回顾过去。我认为，我们应该重拾二战结束时白手起家的精神。（迅销公司正是崛起于这一时期的1949年）。 <br><br>
我们已经失去了这种精神，或许是因为我们产生了我们既富有又比其他国家优越的幻想。但是，许多国家也同样富有，在日本，许多人的收入已经连续10年 或者10多年停滞不前。如果你是个日本人，日本依旧是个生活十分舒适的国家。但是，舒适和生存发展之间是有差别的。我们正在逐渐丧失我们的生存发展能力。 简而言之，日本作为一个经济体已经被彻底击败了。我们正在在经济竞争中失利。那么，我们为何会如此愚蠢？或者更准确地说，我们为何不能从自己的错误中汲取经验教训？ 从错误中学习是优衣库（Uniqlo）这样的企业必须做的――遗憾的是，这样的情况发生了许多次。 <br><br>
2001年，我们在伦敦开了日本以外的第一家分店。但我们却败得轰轰烈烈。我们在英国迅速地开了21家分店――到2003年却关闭了其中的16家。 回顾来看，这或许是件好事，因为我们学到了许多东西。我们最大的错误就是试图以英国的方式做事情。我们从未利用我们自己的长处。 <br><br>
比如，我们让优衣库的英国总裁创建了一支条块分割的管理团队，该团队包括地区经理、店铺经理、店铺经理助理以及销售员工。店铺经理只与其他的店铺经理交流。在日本，我们并没有这样的等级体系。我们的组织是平面的。 中国是我们进入的第二个海外市场，但我们起初是失败的。我们在中国没有取得成功是因为我们在适应中国的情况方面走得太远。中国的人均收入很低――只有日本的5%――于是我们就认为我们应该以很低的价格销售。这是一个错误。<br><br>
优衣库是日本的品牌，没有人想要中国的优衣库。<br><br> 
在蔬菜方面也是个灾难。我们发现食品配送是个落后的行业，于是，我们就在2002年与食品集团Ryokuken结成合作关系。但是，蔬菜并非工业化 的产品；我们无法知道它们什么时候长成，产量是多少。我们最终了解到，除非我们运营自己的农场，否则，我们就不可能成功，但我们又不打算去当农夫。两年 后，我们关闭了这项业务。 <br><br>
重要的并不是我们在这些实例中失败了这么多次，而是我们汲取了教训并且最终取得了成功。在英国，我们现在拥有十多家店铺，其中包括了位于伦敦牛津街 上的旗舰店，而且我们经营得相当出色。中国是我们发展最快的市场，我们在那里拥有了将近100家店铺。我们希望到2020年，我们在中国的店铺数量能够超 过日本（800多家）。优衣库的国际业务发展迅速。我们现在已经在10个国家开设了商店，我们不久还将在泰国、巴西和印度开设分店。到2015年，我们大 多数的日本员工都将在海外工作。 <br><br>
失败总是令人不快，但是，从恰当的角度看，它们却是有益的。我们在英国和中国的辛勤工作增强了我们的恢复力，让我们了解了3个重要的事情。首先，要 想在其他国家创建尽可能出色的优衣库，我们必须利用我们机构中最出色的方面。第二，尽管全球化之路十分艰难，但它是必须的。第三，为了在日本以外获得成 功，我们需要用这些国家自己的语言了解这些市场。<br><br> 
简而言之，优衣库必须既是日本的，又是全球的。这一点也适用于整个日本，这是显而易见的。 日本需要摆脱的一个观念是，处理事情的方法在日本和在其他地方是不一样的。日本人在家里时都很强大，但离开家以后，却令人难以置信地软弱。我们需要 在国外也同样强大的日本人，或者在家里和在外面表现没有什么不同的日本人。我们努力把这一观念融入优衣库的文化。比如，在与外国人进行商务会谈时要讲英 语，我们希望几年内我们所有的电子邮件都使用英语编写。 <br><br>
日本大多数普通行业都受到政府法规或者行业协议（潜规则或者显规则）的束缚。这样做的想法是创建联盟或者协会或者其他什么东西，然后利用它实施某些 规则并避免竞争。<br><br>
我讨厌这种方法。我们尽自己最大的努力避免这种在日本经济中非常常见的政府－产业结构。这样做旨在构建安全网，但事实上，它们却束缚了企 业的全球竞争力。 我给日本年轻人的建议很简单：离开日本。我们日本人的弱点之一是我们不善于与其他文化交流。即使英语讲得很好的人也在心理上自我封闭。他们不会像我一样有话直说。<br><br>
这种冷淡是日本人所特有的，对于过深的交往，我们总是畏缩不前。这对于全球化而言是有害的。 我所讲的这些听上去很悲观，但我并不认为这是一种令人失望的劝告。日本什么都有――人员、商品、金钱、技术和信息等。作为一个国家，我们讲诚信、努力工作，而且严肃认真。那么，为什么我们如此衰弱？为什么我们不能利用这些优势在世界中竞争？ <br><br>
如果我们利用自己拥有的一切并且向着正确的方向前进，我相信，我们会取得成功的。即使我们经历失败，我们也能重整旗鼓，再次尝试。这就是优衣库所做的――这也是日本能够做的。 <br><br>

	<b><a name="T14">Urban world: The shifting global business landscape</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

Emerging markets are changing where and how the world does business. For the last three decades, they have been a source of low-cost but increasingly skilled labor. Their fast-growing cities are filled with millions of new and increasingly prosperous consumers, who provide a new growth market for global corporations at a time when much of the developed world faces slower growth as a result of aging. But the number of large companies from the emerging world will rise, as well, according to a new report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI). This powerful wave of new companies could profoundly alter long-established competitive dynamics around the world.<br><br>

Our research shows that the emerging economies’ share of Fortune Global 500 companies will probably jump to more than 45 percent by 2025, up from just 5 percent in 2000 (Exhibit 1). That’s because while three-quarters of the world’s 8,000 companies with annual revenue of $1 billion or more are today based in developed economies, we forecast that an additional 7,000 could reach that size in little more than a decade―and 70 percent of them will most likely come from emerging markets.1  To put this dramatic shift in the balance of global corporate power in perspective, remember that many of the world’s largest companies have maintained their current status for generations: more than 40 percent of the 150 Western European companies in last year’s Fortune Global 500 had been founded before 1900.<br><br>

A wake-up call for CEOs<br><br>

Corporate leaders can’t afford to be complacent about a change of such magnitude. In fact, we have seen all this before. In the 1970s and 1980s, Japanese carmakers began gaining global market share and, in some cases, outcompeted their US counterparts. More recently, South Korea’s Samsung has weakened Apple’s grip on the global smartphone market. In the decade ahead, this type of story will play out on a much bigger scale, and the rate at which newcomers topple industry leaders will probably accelerate.<br><br>

Such up-and-coming companies could disrupt entire industries by designing superior products at lower cost, by bringing them to market faster, and by streamlining business processes. Many of these businesses, having been nurtured in difficult operating environments, are not only more agile than their counterparts from advanced economies but also prepared to invest for the long term, even if this cuts earnings in the next few quarters. Many new players will be setting their sights on expanding into international markets. Business leaders will have to monitor trends constantly to spot new markets and competitors. They need to meet three imperatives.<br><br>
1.Optimize sales networks. The growth of new businesses is not only a competitive threat to older ones but also gives suppliers and service providers a significant opportunity. B2B companies will need to assess how to organize themselves so they can sell to a much more diverse and dispersed customer base. To do so, they must rethink (and perhaps redeploy) their sales networks.<br><br>
2.Understand how customers and competitors are evolving. New industry hotspots will be sources of both competition and demand, so companies must track up-and-coming hubs in emerging regions. Hsinchu (in northern Taiwan) and Brazil’s Santa Catarina metropolitan district, for example, may not be household names, but they are already hubs for multiple billion-dollar companies in industries such as advanced electronics.<br><br>
3.Reconsider the headquarters configuration and the location of other core activities. Already, many businesses find that the traditional single-headquarters model no longer meets their needs. Companies such as Caterpillar and General Electric have thus split their corporate centers into two or more locations that share decision making, production, R&D, and service leadership. Unilever created a second headquarters, for global development, in Singapore, which now has key members of the company’s senior-leadership team.<br><br>

A big opportunity for cities<br><br>

Today, just 20 major cities host one-third of all large companies. Tokyo is by far the leading hub, with more than 600 large companies. Only nine other cities around the world are home to 100 or more of such companies’ head offices (Exhibit 2).<br><br>
<a href= "pic05.html">大公司聚集的大城市</a><br><br>
In emerging regions, the leading cities for business today are likely to capture a disproportionate share of company growth in the future. The number of large companies based in Sao Paolo, for instance, could more than triple by 2025. Beijing and Istanbul could have more than twice as many head offices as they do today. Yet company headquarters will become more dispersed across the emerging world: about 280 of its up-and-coming cities could host a large company for the first time, thus becoming new hubs in global industry networks.<br><br>

Although many city officials focus on luring corporate head offices, relatively few companies actually move them. But as thousands of global businesses expand into new markets, giving themselves a real choice of locations, the more promising opportunity for cities lies in attracting foreign subsidiaries. China is without a doubt the most powerful growth engine for new global companies, and now is the time for forward-thinking cities to build their reputations among its business leaders. The largest foreign subsidiaries cluster heavily in just a few key cities in each region of the world. Thanks to the highly effective efforts of Singapore’s economic-development board, that country is far and away the location of choice for Western multinationals setting up operations in Asia’s emerging economies. Other cities should learn from Singapore’s approach.<br><br>

The quality of the business environment isn’t the only consideration. Cities with reputations for a high quality of life―such as Prague, Sydney, and Toronto―have been more successful than others in attracting the foreign operations of multinationals. But in selecting locations for future expansion, the emerging world’s more diverse companies may consider a broader set of criteria, including the personal ties of executives educated abroad, the need to diversify family holdings, reputation building at home, or an exceptional willingness to enter frontier markets.<br><br>
The rebalancing of the global business landscape will probably be even faster and more dramatic than the shift of economic growth to emerging regions. Large companies matter, and not just for their ability to create jobs and generate higher incomes; they are also forces for increased productivity, innovation, standard setting, and the dissemination of skills and technology. Their geographic shift will have profound implications for the nature of competition, including not only the race for resources and talent but also, more broadly, the emerging markets’ efforts to reach the next level of economic development and prosperity.<br><br>
